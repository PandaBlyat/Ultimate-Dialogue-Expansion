<!-- ARTIFACTS CONVERSATIONS -->
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_artifacts_msg_1">
    <text>Hey, youve heard bout that shiny thing popping up at the electro anomaly field?</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_artifacts_resp_1_1">
    <text>Yeh, big brains from the eco lab paying fat rubles. If its legit, we are talking life changing cash.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_artifacts_resp_1_2">
    <text>I no like. Last time I chase sparkly rock, me end up with half my face missing. Stay away.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_artifacts_resp_1_3">
    <text>Word is, that thing warps the air and could fry your eyeballs at ten paces. Only fools touch it.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_artifacts_resp_1_4">
    <text>Quite intriguing...such anomalous phenomena often yield unprecedented scientific data, though perilous.</text>
</string>

<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_artifacts_msg_2">
    <text>Found a little rock glowing green. Think itll fetch a price?</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_artifacts_resp_2_1">
    <text>Glow stone, huh? Better wrap that sucker in lead or youll glow too warm funeral, mate.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_artifacts_resp_2_2">
    <text>Could be legit artifact. But careful: handle with tweezers, not mittsâ€”bare hands bad juju.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_artifacts_resp_2_3">
    <text>Eh, probably just hot slag from reactor. Still, fence guys might pay up if you hype it right.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_artifacts_resp_2_4">
    <text>Fascinating discovery, its spectral luminescence suggests high photon emission. Recommend analysis.</text>
</string>

<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_artifacts_msg_3">
    <text>Where is the next dig? Usual haunts are picked clean.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_artifacts_resp_3_1">
    <text>After the last blast, anomalies drift north. Try old watchtower grounds when fog lifts.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_artifacts_resp_3_2">
    <text>Dry spots? Sweet. Fewer rats to tussle. Ill take twice the haul for half the heat.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_artifacts_resp_3_3">
    <text>Someone said Duty boys marked fresh nodes by the riverbank. But they are paranoid bastards.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_artifacts_resp_3_4">
    <text>No clue. Zone keeps her secrets. One day you are king, next you are chow for mutants.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_artifacts_msg_4">
    <text>Spotted a trader hawking about a "heart of the Zone" relic near the bar, anyone know what that is?</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_artifacts_resp_4_1">
    <text>Heart of the Zone? Ha! Thats just fancy talk for a Psi coral chunk. Worth a handful of rubles, tops.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_artifacts_resp_4_2">
    <text>I met that trader last month, sold me a dud. Left me puking for two days. Avoid, comrade.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_artifacts_resp_4_3">
    <text>Intriguing nomenclature. If genuine, its anomalous resonance could yield potent psionic feedback.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_artifacts_resp_4_4">
    <text>Bro, dude is a scammer. He labels any glowing pebble heart to bilk fresh meat outta their cash.</text>
</string>

<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_artifacts_msg_5">
    <text>Heard whispers of a living artifact near the old power station. Moves on its own. Real or rumor?</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_artifacts_resp_5_1">
    <text>Living artifact? You mean that twitchy blob folks say skulks in the dark? Pure folk's tale, I reckon.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_artifacts_resp_5_2">
    <text>I seen it with my own eyes..pulsing amber mass, slithering away when you get close. Gave me nightmares.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_artifacts_resp_5_3">
    <text>Such reports often stem from collective hysteria after emissions. Unlikely any creature exists.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_artifacts_resp_5_4">
    <text>Man, I chased that thing until my boots fell apart. It vanished inside a crevice, never saw a relic so sly.</text>
</string>

<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_artifacts_msg_6">
    <text>Word is, that new artifact bends time. Got anyone seen clocks spinning backward?</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_artifacts_resp_6_1">
    <text>Time warp trinket? Thats pure Zone fairy tale. You will lose more than minutes chasing that nonsense.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_artifacts_resp_6_2">
    <text>I touched it once. felt like reliving my worst nightmares. Never again. Time is a curse here.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_artifacts_resp_6_3">
    <text>Fascinating. A chronometric anomaly could revolutionize our understanding of Zone physics if its real.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_artifacts_resp_6_4">
    <text>I saw my watch spin like crazy once, before it heat up to the point i had to chuck it away. Scared me good.</text>
</string>

<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_artifacts_msg_7">
    <text>Heard creepy crawlers hoarding shiny bits in the mutant burrow. Anyone brave enough to scout it?</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_artifacts_resp_7_1">
    <text>Mutant stash? You daft? Those packs guard their loot with claws and teeth. no thanks.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_artifacts_resp_7_2">
    <text>Last hunter in there came back with a broken leg and missing ribs. If you value life, stay clear.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_artifacts_resp_7_3">
    <text>It is true, Psi beasts collect irradiated fragments. A well placed mine might clear them outâ€¦ at risk.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_artifacts_resp_7_4">
    <text>I once filched a trinket while they slept. Heart pounding, I swear I heard growls in my skull.</text>
</string>

<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_artifacts_msg_8">
    <text>Some claim there is a singing artifact, emits tones that lure you closer. Sound familiar?</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_artifacts_resp_8_1">
    <text>Singing stone yeah, locals call it the Sirens Tear. Folks get hypnotized, wander into anomalies.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_artifacts_resp_8_2">
    <text>I hear no song. just my own heartbeat when I touched it. Then I ran before the zone could eat me.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_artifacts_resp_8_3">
    <text>Acoustic feedback from micro fractures could explain the tones..pure physics! no magic involved.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_artifacts_resp_8_4">
    <text>If it sings, I aint sticking around to duet with. Got scars enough already.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_artifacts_msg_9">
    <text>Spotted a lone sniper clutching a teardrop shaped relic and whispering to it. wtf.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_artifacts_resp_9_1">
    <text>Ah, thats the Echo Shard. Supposedly it replays lost voices. Watch your sanity, or itll echo forever.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_artifacts_resp_9_2">
    <text>I heard that whisperer just babbles nonsense, claims of lost loves and old wars. Probably cracked in the head.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_artifacts_resp_9_3">
    <text>Fascinating psychological tool, if it modulates auditory cortex, we might map memories through neural resonance.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_artifacts_resp_9_4">
    <text>I got one once, kept hearing mums lullaby. Nearly cried myself to sleep every night till I tossed it.</text>
</string>

<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_artifacts_msg_10">
    <text>Spotted a tiny orb that shrinks your packs weight, real or more Zone tall tale?</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_artifacts_resp_10_1">
    <text>Weight shrinker? Might be the Light Core artifact. Heard it bends gravity if it's not a busted trinket junk.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_artifacts_resp_10_2">
    <text>Last time I believed that, I spilled half my ammo when it snapped back. Never trust weight games here.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_artifacts_resp_10_3">
    <text>Literature on gravitonic artifacts is sparse, but a micro singularity effect could account for reduced mass.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_artifacts_resp_10_4">
    <text>Bro, its legit. I hauled twice the loot till I hit a bump. Felt like wings on my shouldersâ€¦until crash.</text>
</string>

<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_artifacts_msg_11">
    <text>Caught wind of a mirror like shard that shows your worst fear. Anyone dare test it?</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_artifacts_resp_11_1">
    <text>Mirror of Dread? No thanks, I've seen nightmares that still crawl under my skin when I blink.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_artifacts_resp_11_2">
    <text>Im not scared of shadows. But glass that knows your soul? Better leave that devils toy in the dirt.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_artifacts_resp_11_3">
    <text>From a cognitive science view, such an artifact could induce a hallucinatory feedback loop via brain wave entrainment. Further testing required.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_artifacts_resp_11_4">
    <text>I cracked it once, saw my own grave. Apparently spent a week muttering to myself. Never again.</text>
</string>

<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_counterfeit_msg_12">
    <text>Someone’s been pushing fake medkits around. Looks real ‘til you need it, then you bleed out clutching gauze and chalk.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_counterfeit_resp_12_1">
    <text>The fuck, we need to look into that.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_counterfeit_resp_12_2">
    <text>Bet it’s those black market rats again. Cut corners, sell to rookies, then vanish.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_counterfeit_resp_12_3">
    <text>Zone’s dangerous enough without your lifeline being a placebo. Someone needs to hang for that.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_counterfeit_resp_12_4">
    <text>I test mine before heading out. No seal? No sale. Not dying because some scumbag watered down adrenaline.</text>
</string>


<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_artifacts_msg_13">
    <text>Found this weird pyramid-shaped crystal near Jupiter. Glows when mutants are near. Anyone seen similar?</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_artifacts_resp_13_1">
    <text>That's a Hunter's Beacon! Rare find. Monolith fanatics pay top rubles for those death traps.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_artifacts_resp_13_2">
    <text>Burn it. Last stalker carrying one got swarmed by snorks in his sleep.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_artifacts_resp_13_3">
    <text>Fascinating! Possibly psionic resonance acting as organic proximity detector.</text>
</string>

<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_artifacts_msg_14">
    <text>Does the "Soul" artifact actually heal mental wounds? Or just Zone fairytale?</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_artifacts_resp_14_1">
    <text>Heals? More like borrows sanity. You'll be smiling while bleeding out.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_artifacts_resp_14_2">
    <text>Traded mine after it made me forget my own name for three days.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_artifacts_resp_14_3">
    <text>Psychotropic properties confirmed. Ecologists pay triple for intact specimens.</text>
</string>

<!-- MUTANTS CONVERSATIONS -->

<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_mutants_msg_1">
    <text>Bloodsucker pack spotted near the old factory. Stay alert!</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_mutants_resp_1_1">
    <text>Christ, again? Third fucking sighting this week Zone is going apeshit.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_mutants_resp_1_2">
    <text>Cheers for the tip. Ill snake around, don't fancy becoming mutant chow.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_mutants_resp_1_3">
    <text>Better grease up the double barrel. Those leech fiends wont know what hit them.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_mutants_resp_1_4">
    <text>The factory is a fucking deathtrap, anyone daft enough to wander in deserves what they get.</text>
</string>

<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_mutants_msg_2">
    <text>Has anyone else noticed more mutants than usual lately?</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_mutants_resp_2_1">
    <text>Yeah, like they are massing up for a fucking invasion. Real shitshow out there.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_mutants_resp_2_2">
    <text>More mutants, more bounties. My pockets are thanking the Zone today.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_mutants_resp_2_3">
    <text>Might be the storms, creatures feel the charge before we do. Nature is twisted here.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_mutants_resp_2_4">
    <text>I do seem to encounter more recently, they must be breeding more or some shit.</text>
</string>

<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_mutants_msg_3">
    <text>Spotted a pack of pseudogiants by the swamp, absolutely massive. Anyone got eyes?</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_mutants_resp_3_1">
    <text>Pseudogiants? Fuck me, that is asking for a quick trip to the afterlife.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_mutants_resp_3_2">
    <text>I saw them too, looked like walking towers.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_mutants_resp_3_3">
    <text>Terrifying specimens, probably mutated by deep water anomalies.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_mutants_resp_3_4">
    <text>Man, Id rather wrestle a pseudodog than meet those cunts head on with a squad fully geared.</text>
</string>

<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_mutants_msg_4">
    <text>Anyone heard growling near the old train cars at night? Sounded unnatural.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_mutants_resp_4_1">
    <text>Yeah, that is the wretched dog things prowling. Give them a flare and watch them scatter.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_mutants_resp_4_2">
    <text>Me? I sleep with earplugs. Let the poor sods howl at ghosts, they wont get me.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_mutants_resp_4_3">
    <text>Acoustic predator behavior increasing, screams replicate pack cohesion. Fascinating, yet deadly.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_mutants_resp_4_4">
    <text>Fucking hell same, I nearly shit myself last night. Kept expecting to feel hot breath on my neck.</text>
</string>

<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_mutants_msg_5">
    <text>Heard the snorks are swarming near the tunnel entrance. Anyone brave enough to clear them?</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_mutants_resp_5_1">
    <text>Snorks? Nah, fuck that. I quit after one nearly tore off my arm.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_mutants_resp_5_2">
    <text>Im gearing up, got new rounds for the SPAS. Lets teach those gurgling freaks a lesson.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_mutants_resp_5_3">
    <text>Observing group hunting tactics snorks coordinate via potential sonar clicks. Starting to consider some kind of heavy acoustic suppression.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_mutants_resp_5_4">
    <text>Last bloke who tried said he heard voices in his head before the swarm hit. Spooky shit.</text>
</string>

<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_mutants_msg_6">
    <text>Saw a lone chimera slinking through the cornfields at duskâ€”looked pissed. Heads up!</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_mutants_resp_6_1">
    <text>Hm, chimeras don't generally wander alone. Somethings really fucked up if its solo.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_mutants_resp_6_2">
    <text>Chimeras freak me the fuck out, i see one im OUT the fucking place, I don't give a fuck what you guys think.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_mutants_resp_6_3">
    <text>Interesting deviation from pack behavior, could indicate territorial pressure or a wounded alpha.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_mutants_resp_6_4">
    <text>Id give my left smaller nut to bag that bastard, but aint stupid enough to try solo.</text>
</string>

<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_mutants_msg_7">
    <text>Heard whisper of a controller haunting the substation tunnels, anyone got proof?</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_mutants_resp_7_1">
    <text>Controller in the tubes? I almost had my brain scrambled last week, pure psychic hell.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_mutants_resp_7_2">
    <text>I aint superstitious, but I saw lights blink without wires and then a voice in my head.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_mutants_resp_7_3">
    <text>Electromagnetic anomalies could explain auditory hallucinations, though psionic field interactions remain uncharted.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_mutants_resp_7_4">
    <text>Bullshit rumor, unless you fancy getting your skull vacuum cleaned, stay the fuck away from those tunnels.</text>

<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_mutants_msg_8">
    <text>Rogue pack of pseudodogs tearing through convoys on the clearance road, any backup teams?</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_mutants_resp_8_1">
    <text>Pseudodogs on the clearance? Fucking brilliant, no safe route left. I am bugging out tonight.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_mutants_resp_8_2">
    <text>Got given orders. set up ambush with flashbangs. Those buggers hate bright lights.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_mutants_resp_8_3">
    <text>Pack coordination suggests higher cognitive function, could be a new subspecies adapting to patrol patterns.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_mutants_resp_8_4">
    <text>I went in solo, came out minus half my gear. don't be a hero; bring friends or don't bother.</text>

    <text>Fucking hell, those scratches will rot your arm if you aint careful.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_mutants_resp_9_2">
    <text>I patched myself up with vodka and iodine, still itching like mad. Might need medics help.</text>

<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_mutants_resp_9_3">
    <text>Dermal irritation from their saliva indicates potent enzymatic agents, recommend topical antivenom creams.</text>

<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_trading_msg_3">
    <text>Heard there is a buyer for Intel on enemy patrol routes, anyone got maps to sell?</text>

<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_trading_resp_3_1">

<string id="st_dyn_news_conversation_trading_resp_3_2">
    <text>Maybe talk to Sidorovichs mole down by the bar. He deals in whispers, not toys.</text>
