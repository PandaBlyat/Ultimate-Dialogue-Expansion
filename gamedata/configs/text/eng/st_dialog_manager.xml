		<text>Sure, easy, it's up in Chernobyl. The next bus leaves in twenty minutes, hehe...
		\nListen stalker, many people before you have come here looking to find the Wish Granter. You know what they all have in common today? They're all worm food... except maybe Strelok. In any case, the Wish Granter is just a legend, a myth. But the money I offer is real. Work hard, play smart and you'll be rich in no time.</text>

Listen stalker, there have been many people before you that have come here looking to find the Wish Granter, you know what they all have in common? They are all feeding the worms right now. The Wish Granter is just a legend, it doesn't exist. Even if it did exist do you know what your wish would be if you found it? That you never went looking for it in the first place. You want to get rich, is that it? You don't need to wish for your fortune. Someone like you can make plenty of money here in the Zone if you are smart. Here is what I will do for you; show me your PDA... Ah, there, I've loaded in a list of contacts, people here in the Zone who I know are looking to have work done. Go visit them when you are ready, some of them pay well. In the meantime, ask around camp, there is plenty of work here, heck, I even have some jobs I need done from time to time. It's an honest living, at least as honest as it gets here in the Zone.</text>

		<text>A volunteer? We are expanding our operations in the area, and there's no end to the surprises the Zone brings us every day. The biggest surprise, however, is the news of Strelok's return. Given that he survived where Lebedev failed... well, I'm sure some of our older boys here would like some answers. Still, even if you don't, I also have a list of contacts who need some work done. Clear Sky can always benefit from maintaining its friendships, especially since some of our previous losses are otherwise irreplaceable.</text>

Finding him is currently a priority, both to me and our supervisors. If you wish to participate in our search for Strelok, I can tell you more. If not... well... I have another important assignment. It involves travelling the Zone and meeting new people to learn as much as you can - There is so much out there we haven't yet discovered. You could consider it... exploratory research.</text>

		<text>Not even I could tell you exactly who, what or where they are. Only that they've got money, and a lot of it. Regardless, this employer has asked we perform favours for a list of "interested parties". Your PDA will be updated with their details as relevant. Stay frosty and watch your back out there - the Zone may be immensely lucrative, but it's also a living hell, and nothing I've seen so far has convinced me otherwise.</text>

No unauthorized personnel are allowed to approach you during your operations. If you can't identify who's coming, shoot first and ask questions later. Your tour of duty will take you all over the Zone, and most of the time no one will be there to help you.\n \nYou must rely on your survival training to stay alive and complete your assignments by any means necessary. Meet with the contacts loaded into your PDA and they will give you your orders. Just complete your tour of duty, keep your heart beating and you'll get to go home with a fat wad of cash in your pocket. You are dismissed.</text>

		<text>Thank you soldier. You have done well for me, now I will do something for you, although you may not want to hear it. You are expecting to rotate out of here soon, yes? I'm afraid the top brass has other ideas. The cordon has closed in and has been locked down, nothing and no one is able to get in or out of the Zone any more, including the military. You've been left here to die, and even your corpse will be left for worm food. You can't even escape in a body bag. But all hope is not lost for you, if you are daring. There is only one way left for you to get out of here, and it lies in Chernobyl. Buried deep within the NPP is the Wish Granter. If you can find it, and if you survive, you can use it to wish your way out of here. It is your only hope soldier. Good luck to you.</text>

I arrange to take care of business for them and in return I expect them to pay me a very hefty sum. I will give you a list of these people. Go to them, do what they ask, and collect the payment. All I require is you give me 20 percent of what they pay when you are finished. Any money you make on the side while you're out there is yours to keep. Good deal, yes? It's more money than you would make pick-pocketing and looting stashes and sticking up rookies I guarantee. Just don't double-cross me, understand? I know everyone in this place, and they can be very motivated to make examples of anyone who tries to rip me off. Now get out of my sight. I have some important business to attend to.</text>

    <text>Alright, stalker. What's your question?</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_universal_npc_start_36">
    <text>Yeah? What do you need?</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_universal_npc_start_37">
    <text>What's so important?</text>

    <text>Fine. What is it?</text>

    <text>Another question? Go on, then.</text>

<string id="dm_universal_npc_start_43">
    <text>Out with it, stalker.</text>

    <text>Make it quick. I'm not your therapist.</text>

    <text>Alright, rookie. What do you need now?</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_universal_npc_start_46">
    <text>You got a question? Fine, ask it.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_universal_npc_start_47">
    <text>This better be worth my time.</text>

    <text>Yeah, sure. What's up?</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_universal_npc_start_49">
    <text>Let's hear it. I'm curious now.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_universal_npc_start_50">
    <text>What? You look like you've seen a poltergeist.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_universal_npc_start_51">
    <text>Zone got you spooked? Speak up.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_universal_npc_start_52">
    <text>Alright, fine. Talk.</text>

    <text>What's the problem?</text>

    <text>Okay, fine. Talk.</text>

    <text>Got something on your mind?</text>

    <text>What's on your mind, stalker?</text>

    <text>Alright, what's eating you?</text>

    <text>You've got something to say? Let's hear it.</text>

    <text>Fine. You've got a minute. Go on.</text>

    <text>Well? What's your question?</text>

    <text>Talk fast. The Zone waits for no one.</text>

    <text>What's so damn important? Talk.</text>

<string id="dm_no_more_1">
    <text>I told you what I know. Now piss off, I'm busy.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_no_more_2">
    <text>Look, my head's already a mess from all this radiation. Ask someone else.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_no_more_3">
    <text>You want me to pull miracles out of my ass now? That's all I've got.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_no_more_4">
    <text>Jesus, man. Get off my dick and go bother someone else.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_no_more_5">
    <text>That's all I can share unless you're buying me vodka.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_no_more_6">
    <text>Keep asking and I'll start charging for my time.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_no_more_7">
    <text>Get lost, rookie. I'm not your damn encyclopedia.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_no_more_8">
    <text>Try again after I've had some sleep. Or not.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_no_more_9">
    <text>I'm tapped out for now. Maybe next time.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_no_more_10">
    <text>That's all I know, and I'm already talking too much.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_no_more_11">
    <text>Shit, man. If I keep yapping, I'll be the next guy who 'disappears.'</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_no_more_12">
    <text>Why don't you shove off and try the bar? They love chatterboxes there.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_no_more_13">
    <text>You're either deaf or stupid. Either way, I'm done talking.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_no_more_14">
    <text>I've got nothing more for you. Move on.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_no_more_15">
    <text>Why don't you ask someone who actually gets paid to think?</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_no_more_16">
    <text>If I knew more, you think I'd still be hanging around this shithole?</text>
</string>

    <text>Seriously, dude. Bug someone else before I lose my patience.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_no_more_18">
    <text>You've wrung me dry, stalker. That's all there is.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_no_more_19">
    <text>The only thing left to tell you is to fuck off.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_no_more_20">
    <text>I've got better things to do than repeat myself.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_no_more_21">
    <text>Enough already! You're worse than a rookie at their first anomaly.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_no_more_22">
    <text>That's it. I'm done. You're on your own now.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_no_more_23">
    <text>If you keep badgering me, the Zone's gonna handle you for me.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_no_more_24">
    <text>You want answers? Go poke around the Red Forest. Good luck coming back.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_no_more_25">
    <text>Zone's got plenty of mysteries. I'm not one of them. Move on.</text>

<string id="dm_no_more_26">
    <text>I've got nothing more for you. I'm out.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_no_more_27">
    <text>Why do I feel like I'm talking to a Bandit with a badge?</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_no_more_28">
    <text>What part of “I'm out” do you not understand?</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_no_more_29">
    <text>You keep asking, but the answer's still “I don't know.”</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_no_more_30">
    <text>Man, you're persistent. Too bad I'm fresh out of answers.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_no_more_31">
    <text>I'd tell you more, but then I'd have to kill you. Kidding. Maybe.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_no_more_32">
    <text>If I hear one more question, I'm gonna lose it.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_no_more_33">
    <text>You've got all I know. You want more, go ask the Zone itself.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_no_more_34">
    <text>Find someone else to grill, rookie.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_no_more_35">
    <text>I'm not your guide. Find someone else to pester.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_no_more_36">
    <text>That's it. I'm officially done here.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_no_more_37">
    <text>Keep it up, and I'll have the Zone swallow you whole.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_no_more_38">
    <text>You want me to dance too? Because I'm not doing that either.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_no_more_39">
    <text>I've got more important shit to worry about than this.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_no_more_40">
    <text>I've told you what I can. Anything else is above my pay grade.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_no_more_41">
    <text>The Zone doesn't like talkative people. Keep that in mind.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_no_more_42">
    <text>You really think I'm holding out on you? Get real.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_no_more_43">
    <text>That's all I know. Go hit up a stalker with more brains.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_no_more_44">
    <text>I've said my piece. That's all you're getting.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_no_more_45">
    <text>You're not gonna get anything more out of me.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_no_more_46">
    <text>Stop. Just stop. I'm done.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_no_more_47">
    <text>You keep pressing, and I'll start asking you questions. Your call.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_no_more_48">
    <text>I've got nothing left. Find someone else.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_no_more_49">
    <text>Rookies these days... always asking, never doing. Go learn something yourself.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_no_more_50">
    <text>Final word: I'm out. No more questions.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_do_not_know_1">
    <text>What do I look like, a Guide? Go find one of those assholes for your answers.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_do_not_know_2">
    <text>Man, the Zone keeps its secrets. You're asking the wrong guy.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_do_not_know_3">
    <text>If I knew that, I'd be living it up in Yanov, not here.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_do_not_know_4">
    <text>Hell if I know. Maybe some Monolith nutjob knows more than I do.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_do_not_know_5">
    <text>You sure you're not from Duty? Asking all these nosy questions...</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_do_not_know_6">
    <text>There's too much weird shit out here for me to keep track of.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_do_not_know_7">
    <text>Stalker, I barely know what day it is. Don't expect wisdom here.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_do_not_know_8">
    <text>Maybe check with a scientist. They might give a damn about your curiosity.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_do_not_know_9">
    <text>Even if I knew, you think I'd risk spilling that kind of info?</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_do_not_know_10">
    <text>Zone's full of mysteries. This one ain't mine to solve.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_do_not_know_11">
    <text>Not a clue. And if you find out, don't bring the mess back to me.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_do_not_know_12">
    <text>Shit, dude. You ask too many questions. Got a death wish?</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_do_not_know_13">
    <text>I'd love to help, but ignorance is bliss, friend.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_do_not_know_14">
    <text>Look, man, I'm just trying to survive here. Ask someone else.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_do_not_know_15">
    <text>Beats me. The Zone doesn't come with a manual.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_do_not_know_16">
    <text>Asking questions like that will get you shot. Just saying.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_do_not_know_17">
    <text>I don't know, and frankly, I don't care to know.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_do_not_know_18">
    <text>Why are you asking me? I'm no Zone historian.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_do_not_know_19">
    <text>You think I've got answers? You're barking up the wrong tree.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_do_not_know_20">
    <text>Sorry, man. Not my area of expertise.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_do_not_know_21">
    <text>My best guess? Some shit you don't want to mess with.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_do_not_know_22">
    <text>I've got no idea. The Zone keeps things interesting, huh?</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_do_not_know_23">
    <text>I don't know, and I'm not about to start guessing.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_do_not_know_24">
    <text>Zone knowledge isn't free, rookie. Not that I have any to sell.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_do_not_know_25">
    <text>Ask me about booze or guns, not this crap.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_do_not_know_26">
    <text>Who knows? Could be the Zone's magic working overtime.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_do_not_know_27">
    <text>I'm not touching that topic with a ten-foot pole.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_do_not_know_28">
    <text>Honestly? I couldn't tell you if my life depended on it.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_do_not_know_29">
    <text>You're better off asking Sidorovich. He loves a good story.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_do_not_know_30">
    <text>I don't have a fucking clue, alright?</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_do_not_know_31">
    <text>Don't ask me. I just shoot things and hope for the best.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_do_not_know_32">
    <text>That's above my pay grade. Way above it.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_do_not_know_33">
    <text>I've got no clue, and I'm not about to find out.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_do_not_know_34">
    <text>You're asking the wrong guy. Try someone smarter.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_do_not_know_35">
    <text>Not a damn idea, stalker. Sorry.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_do_not_know_36">
    <text>The Zone doesn't hand out answers, and neither do I.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_do_not_know_37">
    <text>Not sure. If you figure it out, don't forget to clue me in.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_do_not_know_38">
    <text>I wouldn't know, and I don't care to find out.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_do_not_know_39">
    <text>I'm clueless. Maybe the Zone's screwing with you.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_do_not_know_40">
    <text>No idea, man. Just focus on not getting killed.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_do_not_know_41">
    <text>Zone's got its secrets, and this is one of them.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_do_not_know_42">
    <text>I'm as lost as you are, rookie.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_do_not_know_43">
    <text>Can't help you there. I'd steer clear if I were you.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_do_not_know_44">
    <text>That's a mystery for someone braver than me to solve.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_do_not_know_45">
    <text>Not my problem. Hope you figure it out, though.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_do_not_know_46">
    <text>Beats me. The Zone's full of surprises, none of them good.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_do_not_know_47">
    <text>I couldn't tell you even if I wanted to. I'm out of the loop.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_do_not_know_48">
    <text>Zone's a weird place. That's all I've got for you.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_do_not_know_49">
    <text>Who knows? The Zone doesn't like to explain itself.</text>
</string>

    <text>I don't know, and honestly, I don't want to know.</text>

<string id="dm_anomalies_0">
    <text>Why would I tell you? Trust is hard to come by in the Zone.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_anomalies_1">
    <text>Burners? You see a shimmer, you run. Otherwise, you'll be charcoal before you know it.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_anomalies_2">
    <text>Thermals are already bad, but sometimes they launch fireballs. No one warns you about flying fire.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_anomalies_3">
    <text>A Vortex doesn't just kill you; it paints the walls with what's left. Watch your step, friend.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_anomalies_4">
    <text>Springboards are like landmines you can't see. Chuck bolts, and pray you don't miss one.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_anomalies_5">
    <text>Whirligigs? Those things will rip you apart faster than you can say goodbye. Just stay away.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_anomalies_6">
    <text>Fruit Punch? It's just acid dressed up as a pretty puddle. You'll regret stepping in it.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_anomalies_7">
    <text>“Burnt Fuzz” sounds innocent, right? Wrong. It'll shred you with spores in seconds.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_anomalies_8">
    <text>Gas anomalies are silent killers. You won't even feel it at first, then boom—your legs are gone.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_anomalies_9">
    <text>A Gas Cloud will float towards you like it's alive. Move fast, or you'll melt in its wake.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_anomalies_10">
    <text>Timing is key with Electros. Trigger it, wait, then run. You screw up, you fry.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_anomalies_11">
    <text>A Tesla anomaly? It's like a storm in a jar, zapping around. Beautiful, if it wasn't so deadly.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_anomalies_12">
    <text>Space anomalies? You're gambling with your life, and the Zone always stacks the deck.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_anomalies_13">
    <text>Some say anomalies follow patterns. I say patterns follow anomalies—always expect the unexpected.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_anomalies_14">
    <text>The Red Forest has riches and death in equal measure. Think carefully before you wander in.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_anomalies_15">
    <text>Fault anomalies create cracks deep enough to swallow men. Step light, or step forever.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_anomalies_16">
    <text>Bragging about your finds? Idiocy. You'll be hunted before you can spend a single ruble.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_anomalies_17">
    <text>Gravitational anomalies are greedy, but if you've got the guts and speed, you can cheat 'em.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_anomalies_18">
    <text>Gravis look like scrap, but scientists will pay fortunes for them. Anti-grav tech? Priceless.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_anomalies_19">
    <text>Radiation kills more rookies than anything else. Always pack meds—better broke than dead.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_anomalies_20">
    <text>Artifacts built belt tech, and belt tech makes us better stalkers. It's a cycle that feeds itself.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_anomalies_21">
    <text>Healing artifacts exist, but they're rarer than a stalker who doesn't drink vodka. Good luck.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_anomalies_22">
    <text>“The Compass” artifact is a myth, if you ask me. No anomaly immunity for anyone, friend.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_anomalies_23">
    <text>Campfire talk is where you'll learn the most. Just listen, and you'll figure it out eventually.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_anomalies_24">
    <text>Artifacts lure you in, but anomalies wait to snap shut. Stay sharp, or stay dead.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_anomalies_25">
    <text>The right gear makes the difference. A broken respirator or the wrong meds, and you're done for.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_anomalies_26">
    <text>Artifact hunting takes patience. A good detector, better boots, and nerves of steel help too.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_anomalies_27">
    <text>If you're not rested and alert, anomalies will eat you alive. Sleep, hydrate, and focus.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_anomalies_28">
    <text>The Zone whispers to us, they say. Ignore it, and you'll keep your sanity intact.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_anomalies_29">
    <text>Some stalkers hunt artifacts. Others hunt stalkers. Watch your back, always.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_anomalies_30">
    <text>Sometimes it's better to shoot at an artifact and make it jump. Safer than fetching it yourself.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_anomalies_31">
    <text>In the early days, artifacts didn't irradiate you. Now they do. The Zone's evolving, I guess.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_anomalies_32">
    <text>If you're serious about artifacts, the Ecologists can gear you up. Just be ready to pay.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_anomalies_33">
    <text>Don't treat the Zone like a lottery. It rewards hard work, not blind luck.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_anomalies_34">
    <text>The farther north you go, the better the loot—and the more dangerous it gets.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_anomalies_35">
    <text>Survive long enough, and you'll realize every artifact is a blessing.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_anomalies_36">
    <text>The swamps hide artifacts and death in equal measure. Watch where you step.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_anomalies_37">
    <text>Clusters of artifacts exist, but so do rumors of hauntings. You choose what to believe.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_anomalies_38">
    <text>Thermal anomalies guard treasures, but they'll roast you alive if you're careless.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_anomalies_39">
    <text>The caves are a treasure trove if you make it out alive. That's a big “if.”</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_anomalies_40">
    <text>A Circus anomaly is a rare sight. Beautiful, deadly, and not for the faint-hearted.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_anomalies_41">
    <text>Psychic anomalies? Your brain turns to mush, and then you're a zombie. Avoid them.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_anomalies_42">
    <text>Gravitational anomalies create the weirdest formations. Stunning, if you survive.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_anomalies_43">
    <text>Boiler anomalies can cook you alive. Veterans say the artifacts aren't even worth it.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_anomalies_44">
    <text>Acid anomalies near the quarry are tough to deal with, but they pay off big time.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_anomalies_45">
    <text>Ghost stories and zombies aside, Kopachy is a goldmine if you survive the graveyard.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_anomalies_46">
    <text>Electro fields? Dangerous but lucrative. Bring bolts and a good detector.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_anomalies_47">
    <text>Anomalous Grove grows every time an artifact's removed. Makes you think, doesn't it?</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_anomalies_48">
    <text>Concrete Bath is creepy as hell, but it's worth the effort for acid artifacts.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_anomalies_49">
    <text>Bitumen is a thermal-gravitational hybrid. Dangerous, but it's like nothing else in the Zone.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_anomalies_50">
    <text>Every anomaly is deadly, but some hide treasures beyond imagining. Just don't die finding them.</text>

</string>
<string id="dm_information_4">
    <text>The Cordon? It's the closest thing the Zone has to a vacation spot. Rookies learn the ropes, veterans take a breather, and the Military occasionally shows up to shoot anything that moves. Just don't let the quiet fool you. One wrong step, and the Zone'll still gut you like a pig.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_5">
    <text>Darkscape and the Meadow? Peaceful my ass. Sure, it's quiet if you like the sound of wind and your own heartbeat. But spend enough time there, and you start feeling like you're being watched. Maybe it's the mutants. Maybe it's something else. I'm not sticking around to find out.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_6">
    <text>Dark Valley wasn't always a Bandit shithole, you know. It used to be a research hub. Geodesists, engineers, real brainy types. Of course, that was before the labs started spitting out horrors nobody could explain. Now? It's just another graveyard with a few thugs standing on it.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_7">
    <text>Dead City has a whole sewer system underneath it. Big enough for a grown man to walk through. I've used it a couple times to raid Merc stashes. Just don't linger down there too long. It's dark, damp, and smells like death. And if the mutants don't get you, the Mercs sure as hell will.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_8">
    <text>The Flea Market in the Garbage? Yeah, those traders up on the hill? Don't trust 'em. They're not just selling junk; they're watching everyone who comes through. Who for? Who knows. But I wouldn't be surprised if they're selling info to the highest bidder, too.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_9">
    <text>You want information? Check your PDA. Or better yet, go see Snitch in Rostok. Just don't expect charity. That bastard'll charge you for every scrap of intel he's got, and he's not above selling you out if someone offers him a better deal.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_10">
    <text>The Deserted Hospital up near Limansk? Yeah, it's anything but deserted. The place is crawling with crazies, and any medical gear worth a damn was looted years ago. But if you're stupid enough to go there, I hear there's still a stash or two hidden in the walls. Good luck finding it without getting your face bashed in.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_11">
    <text>Jupiter's a goldmine for artifacts, sure, but getting there? Jesus, it's a nightmare. Every route's a gauntlet of mutants, anomalies, and Monolith assholes just waiting to blow your head off. But hey, if you're feeling lucky, who am I to stop you?</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_12">
    <text>The Underground in Jupiter? Forget it. Monolith's got the entrance locked down tighter than a nun's you-know-what, and the tunnels are crawling with mutants. You'd have better luck swimming through an acid anomaly.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_13">
    <text>Limansk? Hah! It's a meat grinder. Monolith pushes from the north, Mercs from the south, and in between, it's just you, the anomalies, and whatever mutants haven't starved to death yet. You're better off anywhere else.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_14">
    <text>Clear Sky? Yeah, I've heard of them. They've got a hidden base down in the Swamps. Friendly enough, but they keep to themselves. Some say they're working on something big. Others say they're just trying to survive. Either way, they're good people if you can find them.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_15">
    <text>Freedom likes to talk a big game about protecting the Zone. But when was the last time you saw them take on the Monolith? Hell, they can't even handle a Bandit raid without crying for help.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_16">
    <text>Monolith's got Pripyat locked down tighter than ever. It's bad, man. Really bad. They've got enough firepower to flatten the place, but instead, they just sit there, waiting. For what? Who the fuck knows. Just stay the hell away from there.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_17">
    <text>Mercs in the Outskirts? Yeah, I've heard about them. Stranded, desperate, and selling high-end gear for dirt cheap. It's tempting, but you know what they say about deals that are too good to be true...</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_18">
    <text>Radar? Fuck that noise. Doesn't matter if the Brain Scorcher's active or not. That place is cursed. Anomalies, mutants, and Monolith bastards everywhere. Go there, and you might as well dig your own grave first.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_19">
    <text>Forester? Yeah, he's a wizard with tech. Can fix anything with just his hands. But his prices? Fucking insane. And don't even get me started on the trip to the Red Forest. You're more likely to end up as mutant chow than to make it to his workshop.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_20">
    <text>Wild Territory? More like Hell on Earth. Mutants everywhere, Monolith on one side, Duty on the other. It's a goddamn shooting gallery, and you're the target. If you value your skin, find another route.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_21">
    <text>The Wish Granter? Hah, every rookie and his dog's heard of that one. Some say it's real, buried deep under the NPP. Others say it's just a fairy tale. Me? I think it's just another Zone trap, luring in idiots with dreams of glory. But hey, if you're dumb enough to chase it, knock yourself out.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_22">
    <text>Yantar? Yeah, it's a nightmare. Zombies spew out of that factory like it's a fucking clown car, and every third one used to be someone you knew. If you're not ready to put a bullet in your buddy's head, don't go there.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_23">
    <text>Up in Zaton, there's a ship called the Skadovsk. It's a floating shithole, but it's got everything you need—traders, technicians, even a barman. Just watch your back. The walls have ears, and not everyone there's your friend.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_24">
    <text>One of the top stalkers croaked not long ago. Word is, he had stashes all over the Zone, full of high-end loot. Now everyone's scrambling to find them. Me? I think I'll sit this one out. Too many corpses chasing ghosts.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_25">
    <text>Lab recoveries? Fuck that. You get sent down there, you're not coming back. And if you do, you'll wish you hadn't. I've seen guys come out of those labs with their minds fried, babbling nonsense until they finally ate a bullet.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_26">
    <text>Your PDA guide is a lifesaver, man. Whoever keeps that thing updated must have balls of steel—or no brain at all. But hey, don't trust it completely. Maps can't dodge mutants or anomalies for you.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_27">
    <text>You ever hear about that guy who tried to take down a Monolith soldier alive? Idiot got too close to a fanatic he thought was dead. Turns out the bastard had a grenade pinned under him. Boom—no more guy, no more gear, just bits of stalker all over the place.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_28">
    <text>Darkscape used to be the Bandits' highway between Cordon and Dark Valley. These days? Nobody cares about it. That makes it a great spot to disappear. You planning to lay low, or are you just curious?</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_29">
    <text>Stay on Sultan's good side, and he'll make sure no Merc or Bandit messes with you. But cross him? Hah, you'll be lucky if your corpse ends up in one piece. That bastard doesn't fuck around.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_30">
    <text>You know what rookies are? Target practice. They wander into the Zone with pop guns and think they're hot shit. Then they meet a real stalker—or worse, a mutant. Makes you wonder why they even bother.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_31">
    <text>The Ecologists and their hazmat suits? Jesus, it's like a parade of rainbow clowns out there. If it weren't for their guards, they'd be mutant chow in seconds. But hey, at least they're trying, right?</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_32">
    <text>Monolith soldiers? I don't know if they're brainwashed, insane, or just plain stupid. But one thing's for sure—they don't fear death. Makes them a pain in the ass to deal with.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_33">
    <text>The eggheads may be smart, but most of them wouldn't last a day without their guards. I've seen one of them try to reload a pistol once. Almost shot his own foot off. Stick to science, professor.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_34">
    <text>Duty? They act all righteous, but they're just another gang with fancy uniforms. Sure, they keep the mutants in check, but don't let their speeches fool you—they're in it for themselves like everyone else.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_35">
    <text>Freedom's all talk. They'll tell you they're protecting the Zone, but they couldn't even hold Dark Valley without help. Don't believe everything they say, pal. Actions speak louder than words.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_36">
    <text>The Military in the Zone is a joke. Their commanders are clueless, their grunts are cannon fodder, and their plans? Hah, what plans? They're just flailing around, hoping for the best.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_37">
    <text>Heard this crazy thing about the Flash artifact. Sakharov's team apparently figured out it's got enough power to outmatch a nuclear reactor. They're keeping it hush-hush, though. Wonder why?</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_38">
    <text>Yantar's gone to shit. Duty pulled out, and the zombies are pouring in. It's like a bad horror flick over there. Makes you wonder how long the eggheads can hold out before they're overrun.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_39">
    <text>Bandits are the scum of the Zone. They'll steal your gear, beat you senseless, and leave you to bleed out. The world would be a better place if every last one of them got sucked into an anomaly.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_40">
    <text>Guides? Worth every fucking ruble. They know every safe path through the Zone, and they'll get you where you need to go without a scratch—if you can afford their rates, that is.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_41">
    <text>You ever stop and just watch the Zone? The way anomalies hum and shimmer, the colors changing with the light... It's beautiful, in a fucked-up way. Just don't let it distract you, or you'll end up part of the scenery.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_42">
    <text>Voronin's been quiet lately. Too quiet. If Duty doesn't get its shit together, someone's gonna swoop in and take Rostok out from under them. And you can bet it won't be pretty.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_43">
    <text>Duty loves to play hero, but you know what they're really good at? Making speeches. They'll talk your ear off about “protecting the world,” but when it comes down to it, they're just another gang fighting for scraps.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_44">
    <text>Freedom's leaders? They've got their heads up their asses half the time. But I'll give them this—they know how to keep their people loyal. Respect goes a long way out here.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_45">
    <text>You know what's worse than mutants? Stalkers who think they're invincible. I've seen too many cocky bastards walk into the Zone with smiles on their faces, only to leave in body bags—or not at all.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_46">
    <text>They say the Zone changes people. Makes them harder, colder. I don't know if that's true, but I do know this: spend enough time out here, and you'll start to see things differently. It's not just a place; it's alive.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_47">
    <text>Mutants are bad enough, but you know what really scares me? The shit we don't understand. The whispers, the shadows, the things that don't make sense. The Zone's full of mysteries, and not all of them want to be solved.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_48">
    <text>You ever hear about the stalker who tried to live off mutant meat? Guy was too broke to afford supplies, so he started cooking boar steaks. He lasted about two weeks before he started puking blood. Don't be that guy.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_49">
    <text>Some stalkers talk about the Zone like it's a goldmine. Riches around every corner, artifacts just waiting to be picked up. But the truth? The Zone takes more than it gives. If you're not ready to pay the price, stay out.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_50">
    <text>Strelok. You've heard the name, right? Some say he's a legend. Others say he's just another stalker trying to survive. Me? I think he's both. Either way, if you ever meet him, keep your distance. The Zone seems to follow him wherever he goes.</text>
</string>

<string id="dm_information_51">
    <text>Still losing stalkers to that goddamn Brain Scorcher. You know the type—foil hats, pills stuffed in every pocket, thinking they can outsmart the Zone. Most don't make it back. The ones who do? They're like empty shells, muttering gibberish or just staring at their hands like they don't remember what fingers are for.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_52">
    <text>Sakharov's been cranking out new psychic protection gear. Top-notch stuff, but the old bastard doesn't advertise worth shit. You'd think he'd set up shop like any trader, but no—you gotta go through hell and high radiation just to get near him. Still, worth it if you don't want a Controller playing hacky sack with your brain.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_53">
    <text>The labs? Fuck, man. They're like the Zone's stomach acid, dissolving anyone stupid enough to go inside. But the ones who survive come out with artifacts and tech that can make you richer than a goddamn oligarch. Or so they say. Me? I don't need to see mutant brains in jars to know it's not worth the risk.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_54">
    <text>Dark Valley's old base? Creepy as hell, but I'd take it over this shithole near Radar any day. The radiation's worse than your ex's cooking, and the mutants don't even wait for sundown. If Lukash doesn't grow a pair and clear out those Bandits soon, we're all gonna end up as Zone fertilizer.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_55">
    <text>You broke? Eat mutant meat. Seriously. It's not gourmet—hell, it's barely edible—but it'll keep you alive while you save up for proper gear. Just don't forget to cook the shit out of it, unless you want to crap blood for a week.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_56">
    <text>Leshiy got stuck in a Spatial Anomaly back in 2011. Poor bastard was trapped on the same patch of grass for days, with a city always just out of reach on the horizon. No supplies, no comms, just him and his thoughts. By the time he got out, he wasn't the same. Lucky to be alive, sure—but was it worth it?</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_57">
    <text>Patrol duty's a pain in the ass no matter where you are, but the Cordon? At least it's boring. No Swamp mutants, no Monolith fanatics, just you and the road. Beats getting eaten alive or turned into a human torch, if you ask me.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_58">
    <text>Yantar? Yeah, I'm hoping to get posted there. Better bunks, a steady paycheck, and less chance of getting shot in the ass by some drunk rookie. Sure, the zombies are a nightmare, but I'd take that over being stuck with these assholes any day.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_59">
    <text>Bolts save lives, stalker. Always carry some on you. Throw one ahead before you step, and if it bounces weird, stay the hell away. Yeah, it's basic, but you wouldn't believe how many dumbasses think they're too cool to check for anomalies. Spoiler alert: they end up as Zone jerky.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_60">
    <text>Dead stalkers aren't just loot pinatas—they're lifesavers. Always grab their meds, even the ones that look dodgy. A dirty bandage might not be your first choice, but when your buddy's bleeding out, you'll be glad you have it.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_61">
    <text>The Great Swamps are a shitshow, thanks to the Renegades and the Military. Nobody knows what the hell they're doing there, but they're making life hell for everyone else. Maybe one day someone like Scar will show up and clean house again. Until then, avoid that cesspool if you can.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_62">
    <text>Toolkits are like gold out here. Every technician wants at least three sets, but most of 'em end up in anomalies or buried with their previous owners. If you find one, guard it with your life—or sell it for a small fortune.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_63">
    <text>Information? Man, I've been here for three years and I don't even know what I'm looking for anymore. All my friends are dead, buried under shitty wooden crosses in the Zone. Some days, I think about joining them. Maybe it's better that way.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_64">
    <text>Bloodsucker Village in the Army Warehouses? Supposedly empty now. But with bloodsuckers, “empty” just means they're hiding. I wouldn't go near it unless you're feeling suicidal—or you've got a flamethrower handy.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_65">
    <text>Why am I here? Same reason as everyone else: unfinished business. My grandfather never made it out of the '86 disaster. They just left him to rot in the Zone. I'm here to find him, or what's left of him, and put him to rest. Maybe then I'll find some peace.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_66">
    <text>They say there are places in the Zone so twisted that even mutants stay the fuck away. Just thinking about it makes my skin crawl. If the monsters won't go there, what the hell could be worse?</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_67">
    <text>Bandits are assholes, but this new game of theirs? It's sick. They call it the “Rookie Marathon.” Strip a guy down to his undies and make him run through radiation fields back to base. Most don't make it. The ones who do? They're as good as dead anyway.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_68">
    <text>The best hitmen don't just show up guns blazing—they blend in. Disguises, fake IDs, the whole nine yards. You never see them coming. One minute you're chatting with a stalker, the next you're bleeding out. Paranoia's your best friend in the Zone.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_69">
    <text>Mercs used to be all over the place, running independent ops. Now? It's like someone's pulling their strings, organizing them. I don't know who or why, but whatever it is, it's making them dangerous as hell.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_70">
    <text>Mercenaries come from all walks of life—Foreign Legion, Spetsnaz, even insurgents. Out here, none of that shit matters. The Zone chews up resumes and spits out survivors. If they're alive, they're dangerous.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_71">
    <text>Free Stalkers or Bandits—hard to say who's worse. At least with Bandits, you know they'll screw you over. Free Stalkers? Half of 'em are just as shady, but they'll smile while they stab you in the back.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_72">
    <text>Dead City's no secret anymore, but it's still a ghost town. Not many people want to deal with Monolith snipers or the Mercs who call it home. Can't say I blame them.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_73">
    <text>Rookies piss me off. They act like the Zone's some kind of playground, flashing their loot, playing music on their PDAs, thinking a Makarov can save them. The Zone doesn't forgive stupidity, and rookies are proof of that.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_74">
    <text>You know what's great about the Zone? No governments, no taxes, no bullshit. Just freedom. Sure, it's deadly as fuck, but at least it's honest about it.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_75">
    <text>Feel like gambling with your life? Try taking on a Merc or a Monolith patrol. Their gear's top-notch, and if you can kill them, it's yours. But don't cry to me if you end up as dog food.</text>
</string>

<string id="dm_information_76">
    <text>The Military's gear might look tempting, but don't bother. Their armor's always shot to shit by the time you pry it off their corpse, and their guns? Barely worth the effort unless you're desperate. Stick to easier targets if you want loot that actually works.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_77">
    <text>Some idiots are planning to raid an Ecologist bunker. What a fucking joke. Even if they manage to crack the defenses, what's the plan after that? You can only skin the bear once—it won't grow its fur back just because you're hungry.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_78">
    <text>The Military's morale is in the toilet, and it shows. None of us know what the hell they're even here for. Are they guarding the Zone? Invading it? Keeping mutants in, or keeping stalkers out? Whatever it is, it's a clusterfuck of epic proportions.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_79">
    <text>Contraband's flowing out of the Zone faster than ever, and the higher-ups don't give a damn. You'd think they'd try to stop it, but nah. Half of them are probably getting rich off the smugglers, and the other half are too clueless to notice.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_80">
    <text>Our radar keeps picking up aircraft flying near the center of the Zone. In and out, like it's nothing. Supposedly impossible, right? No plane can get near the NPP without turning into a fireball. But the radar doesn't lie. Something's up, and I don't like it.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_81">
    <text>The Military has a special punishment for fuckups—they send you north of the Barrier with no air support and no chance of evac. Basically a death sentence, but at least you get to die knowing you're not their problem anymore.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_82">
    <text>The Security Service of Ukraine is running the show now. Some of the vets are pissed, but honestly? Maybe it's for the best. At least they've got some kind of plan, which is more than I can say for the brass.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_83">
    <text>The Monolith speaks, and we obey. It is our duty, our honor, our curse. It promises victory, a world reborn, if we serve without question. Trespassers must be dealt with, swiftly and without mercy. To defy the Monolith is to defy fate itself.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_84">
    <text>If you're captured, give them nothing. No names, no plans, no truths. Your life is forfeit the moment you fail. Protect the Monolith at all costs. Let them torture you, kill you—it doesn't matter. The Monolith endures. Always.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_85">
    <text>Pray with me, brother: Blessed is the stalker who treads not the paths of heretics, nor joins the infidels in sin. His delight is in the Monolith, his strength in its glory. The wicked are like ash before the wind, and they shall not stand in the congregation of the faithful. The Monolith knows the righteous and shuns the unworthy. Glory be to It forever.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_86">
    <text>Do you remember your life before this? I… I think I had a wife, maybe a child. But they're gone now, like smoke in the wind. The Monolith is all that remains. It fills the void, gives me purpose. What else matters?</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_87">
    <text>You think our armor keeps us alive? Our Gauss rifles, our exoskeletons? No. It is faith, pure and unshakable, that shields us from the infidel. Without it, we are nothing but corpses waiting to fall.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_88">
    <text>The Zone is unlike anything humanity has faced. It's not just a place—it's a challenge, a riddle. We must embrace it, understand it, or it will destroy us. I only hope more stalkers see the truth before it's too late.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_89">
    <text>Freedomers piss me off. They think they're so laid back, but all they do is peddle drugs and bullshit. They turn good men into lazy, strung-out wastes of space. Hell, I bet even bloodsuckers think they're easy prey.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_90">
    <text>Artefacts aren't toys, you know. The Ecologists barely understand them, and yet these idiots are smuggling them out like candy. Every artifact that leaves the Zone is a loaded gun waiting to go off. Someone's going to pay the price—probably all of us.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_91">
    <text>Join Duty, stalker. It's not just about fighting mutants—it's about protecting what's left of the world from the Zone. I lost my best friend to a Controller. Watched him turn into something… inhuman. You don't want to see that happen to someone you care about.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_92">
    <text>Rostok's a mess. They used to have strict entry requirements, but now anyone can waltz in—Bandits, Mercs, you name it. It's only a matter of time before someone blows the place sky-high. Mark my words.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_93">
    <text>Duty doesn't know shit about the Zone. They think it's some evil to be eradicated, but they're just playing soldier in a war they don't understand. Meanwhile, the real enemies laugh at their ignorance.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_94">
    <text>Emissions near the Barrier are bad enough, but when you're close to Pripyat? Fuck me, man, it's a death sentence. The Monolith knows they're immune, so they time their attacks perfectly. It's like they're playing goddamn chess while we're stuck playing checkers.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_95">
    <text>Mercs are unpredictable as hell. Sometimes they'll help you out; other times, they'll blow your head off without a second thought. They hate Duty, though, so that makes them alright in my book—sometimes.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_96">
    <text>Duty's all bark and no bite. They talk about “protecting the world,” but they can't even clear the Wild Territory. And the Ecologists? Don't even get me started. If they're the Zone's defenders, we're all fucked.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_97">
    <text>Somehow, Duty managed to swipe a bunch of grenade launchers from right under our noses. Crafty bastards. Just hope they're planning to use them on mutants and not anyone I care about.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_98">
    <text>Artefacts may be the Zone's treasure, but don't underestimate mutant samples. Scientists will pay through the nose for a fresh bloodsucker's heart or a Chimera claw. And hey, less mutants out there means fewer assholes trying to eat you.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_99">
    <text>You ever wonder why scientists pay so much for artefacts? It's not just curiosity—it's fear. Every artefact smuggled out of here is a potential disaster waiting to happen. Radiation, psychic effects, who knows what else? One day, it's gonna bite us all in the ass.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_100">
    <text>Mutants and anomalies aren't the only things the Zone changes. It gets inside your head, makes you harder, colder. Even the ones who don't die out here come back different. The Zone doesn't let anyone leave the same.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_101">
    <text>Duty, Freedom, whatever. They're both missing the point. The Zone doesn't care about your politics. The only way to deal with it is to study it, understand it, and maybe, just maybe, survive it.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_102">
    <text>The Brain Scorcher and the Miracle Machine? Different psychic frequencies, apparently. Sakharov's got devices that protect you from one but not the other. Useful, sure, but Controllers still fuck people up left and right. Science hasn't saved us yet.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_103">
    <text>The Zone is alive, man. You can't fight it, you can't tame it, and you sure as hell can't ignore it. Duty and Freedom both think they're doing the right thing, but they're just pissing off something way bigger than themselves. Good luck with that.</text>

		<text>Hey Stalker, if you run into any interesting scientific material, be sure to visit our home in the Swamps and let Professor Kalancha take a look. It'll help make the Zone a better place, one sample at a time.</text>

		<text>Lately the radiation trapped in all the Zone's vehicles has been released... and is being pulled into all the water instead. Can't say that's a fair trade - purifying drinkable liquid has become that much harder now.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_107">
		<text>Professor Kalancha says that the Monolith are the key to many of the Zone's mysteries. Certainly, their occupation of Pripyat and the NPP alone is impressive, let alone their technology... I wonder how they did it?</text>

	<string id="dm_information_108"> <!-- Living Legend -->
		<text>People have been talking a lot about that legendary stalker who made it to the CNPP several years ago. Apparently, he reappeared a few days ago. Why is he still in the Zone? Fuck if I care. Better ask the right people if you want a clue.</text>

	<string id="dm_information_109"> <!-- Mortal Sin -->
		<text>My friends and I were having a nice meal at the campfire last night. But then that creepy guy came out of nowhere to preach to us about his silly cult, wonders of the Zone and some other shit that I can't quite remember. Apparently, they are recruiting new members... Hell! I can't tell if he was serious or high.
		\nThe whole thing seems fishy, you should be careful. I heard that many other groups met him the other day. I'm pretty sure that some can be crazy enough to believe his crap.</text>

<string id="dm_information_150">
    <text>You ever been up to the northern reaches near the NPP? They say the anomaly fields there are straight out of a goddamn nightmare. Burner pits that glow like hellfire, gravity wells that twist steel like tissue paper... And the artifacts? Worth more than my sorry ass will make in a lifetime. Only the suicidal or the outright insane dare venture that far. Makes you wonder if the Zone wants them or if it's just thinning the herd.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_151">
    <text>I was exploring an old substation when I saw a light coming from the basement. Not your average glow—this was different. The whole air around it seemed to pulse, like it was alive, breathing. I couldn't pin down the color; it was like staring at the edge of madness. Before I could get a closer look, a pack of dogs came out of nowhere. Nearly pissed myself. That light's still on my mind, though. Maybe it's better I didn't stick around to find out what it was.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_152">
    <text>The Zone's full of marvels, sure, but it's also a breeding ground for horrors. Ever seen a 'zombie' up close? They're not the shambling corpses from old movies. These poor bastards still breathe, still eat, but their minds are gone. Just husks. Makes you wonder, are they in pain? Do they even know what they've become? Either way, get too close, and they'll rip your guts out without a second thought. The Zone doesn't do mercy.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_153">
    <text>Mutants are evolving faster than we can study them. Just the other day, I saw a tushkano with two heads gnawing on a boar corpse. Two fucking heads, man. I don't know what's worse—the thought of what's causing these mutations or the idea that one day they'll outsmart us. Either way, we're just another link in the food chain out here.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_154">
    <text>Some stalkers rolled into Sakharov's lab last week, hauling a pair of artifacts no one had ever seen before. They were jittery, kept looking over their shoulders like something had followed them. When Sakharov offered to pay, they barely argued, just dumped the artifacts and left. Didn't even stay the night. Makes you wonder what they saw—or what those artifacts did to them.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_155">
    <text>I didn't sign up for this shit. I've got a family—a wife, kids, a cozy little house. Then the Ukrainian government decides that theoretical physicists are better off playing guinea pig in the Zone. Now I'm here, knee-deep in mutant blood and radiation, trying not to lose my sanity. Goddamn it. Maybe one day I'll see my kids again. If this place doesn't kill me first.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_156">
    <text>You wouldn't believe the market for Zone samples outside. A single piece of flesh tissue can fetch thousands, and don't even get me started on rare artifacts. It's ironic, really—scientists in fancy labs fighting over scraps from a place they'd never set foot in. Meanwhile, we're here dodging bullets and mutants just to get those scraps. Fucking parasites.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_157">
    <text>Emissions are bad enough here, but did you know some blowouts are affecting areas outside the Zone? Border guards are reporting strange illnesses, electronic malfunctions, even wildlife acting erratically. Some of us think a “super-surge” could double the Zone's size, maybe more. Imagine that—this hellhole spreading like a cancer. Makes you wonder if it's alive, growing, waiting for something.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_158">
    <text>The Zone is a goldmine of scientific discovery. We could learn from it for decades—hell, centuries! But all this violence and chaos? It's holding us back. If we could just cut out the mutants, bandits, and all the other bullshit, imagine what we could achieve. Maybe one day... if the Zone doesn't eat us alive first.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_159">
    <text>Artifacts and anomalies are fascinating, sure, but the real treasure? The documents buried in underground labs. These aren't just dusty old papers—they're decades of research, experiments, data. Some of it's downright horrifying. The scientists who wrote them? Either geniuses or psychopaths. Maybe both. We've barely scratched the surface, and honestly? I'm not sure we want to.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_160">
    <text>Did you know Controller brain tissue remains active even after it's removed? Professor Ozersky's been poking at it with electrodes, trying to map out its responses. Creepy shit. Imagine being dead and still having your brain respond to stimuli. Makes you wonder—are Controllers really dead? Or are they something else entirely?</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_161">
    <text>Psy fields are the future. A century ago, people laughed at the idea of psychic phenomena, called it pseudoscience. Now? The Brain Scorcher and Miracle Machine have proven otherwise. These fields are precise, powerful, and utterly terrifying. If we can understand them, harness them... or maybe we shouldn't. Some knowledge is better left buried.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_162">
    <text>Spent a week studying a thermal anomaly near the plant. Careful measurements, detailed notes—then some asshole swipes my research documents while I'm asleep. All that work, gone. The Zone doesn't just test your science—it tests your patience, your sanity. And right now, I'm failing the test.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_163">
    <text>If you ever stumble across a Death Lamp artifact, leave it the fuck alone. I found one once—kept hearing whispers, seeing things that weren't there. I dumped it as fast as I could, but the nightmares stuck around. And that research lab that tried to study one? It's gone now. Burned to the ground with everyone inside. Coincidence? I think not.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_164">
    <text>The Ecologists aren't sitting on their asses anymore. We're arming ourselves, forming patrols, going deeper into the Zone than ever before. It's risky, yeah, but waiting around to be eaten by mutants or shot by bandits? Fuck that. If we want to survive, we've got to take the fight to them. Science needs warriors too.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_165">
    <text>Thinking of visiting Sakharov? Be careful. He's a brilliant man, no doubt, but he's also got a habit of sending stalkers on suicide missions. If he asks you to retrieve something from a lab or anomaly field, make damn sure you're ready. Or better yet, don't go at all.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_166">
    <text>The Monolith are growing stronger, or so I've heard. It's not our problem—yet—but their fanaticism is unsettling. Where do they get their weapons, their tech? How do they keep fighting like that? It's like they're drawing strength from the Zone itself. And that's a terrifying thought.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_167">
    <text>You know, I used to think the Zone was just a weird ecosystem. Now? I'm not so sure. I've seen too much pain, too much malice. This place isn't natural—it's malevolent. Watch your back, stalker. The Zone doesn't just kill—it corrupts, twists, breaks you. And then it laughs.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_168">
    <text>Chimeras were rare when we first got here, but now? They're everywhere. Bigger, meaner, deadlier. Their muscles are like steel cables, their hides tougher than most armor. Some scientists want to study them, dissect them. Me? I just want to stay the hell away. Let someone braver—or stupider—deal with them.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_169">
    <text>Can't sleep? Imagine this: right now, in some underground lab or abandoned factory, new horrors are being born. Mutants we've never seen, phenomena we can't explain. The Zone doesn't rest, and it sure as hell won't let us, either. Sweet dreams.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_170">
    <text>We can't rely on anyone else for protection—not Duty, not Mercenaries, not the Military. If we want to keep studying the Zone, we need to defend ourselves. Guns, armor, training—it's the only way. Science isn't just about discovery. It's about survival.</text>
</string>

<string id="dm_information_171">
    <text>Guard duty at Yantar is like playing Russian roulette with a fully loaded revolver. Hours of nothing but stale air and your own thoughts, then BAM—snorks or zombies come out of nowhere, and you're suddenly fighting for your life. We need more support out here. Or maybe a miracle. Hell, I'd even settle for some decent sleep.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_172">
    <text>You know what keeps me up at night? Thinking about who's really pulling the strings here. Our mission is supposed to be about science, about understanding the Zone, but some of the orders coming down the chain? They reek of ulterior motives. Maybe we need an ethics board—or a priest.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_173">
    <text>The bureaucrats outside don't have a clue. They sit in their air-conditioned offices, sipping coffee, while we're out here dodging mutants and praying our Geiger counters don't start screaming. They talk about the Zone like it's just another research site. Idiots. They wouldn't last a day here.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_174">
    <text>Some days, I dream about a chopper swooping in to take us away. Pack up the lab, the data, the samples, and just leave this godforsaken place behind. Then I remember the Zone doesn't let anyone go without a fight. And I'm not sure I'd win.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_175">
    <text>It pisses me off. We're here to study the Zone's wonders, to make sense of its chaos, and instead, we're caught up in faction wars and politics. Every day it's another bribe, another deal, another gunfight. I didn't sign up to play pawn in this bloody chess game. I just wanted to do science.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_176">
    <text>I overheard Sakharov and Hermann arguing yesterday. Something about supplies and personnel being rerouted. They were at each other's throats like rabid dogs. Makes you wonder—if the so-called “brains” of this operation can't get along, what hope do the rest of us have?</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_177">
    <text>Everyone here is crazy. Bandits, stalkers, even the scientists. Violence, betrayal, death—it's just another day in the Zone. Makes you wonder, who in their right mind would come here willingly? Answer: no one. This place eats sanity like a bloodsucker drains blood.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_178">
    <text>I've started to see Duty in a new light. At least they understand the dangers of the Zone and take action. Meanwhile, I've watched too many idiots treat artifacts like toys or lucky charms. Duty might be heavy-handed, but at least they get that this place isn't a game.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_179">
    <text>The Zone is a powder keg, and we're the poor bastards stuck in the middle. If a faction war breaks out, we're fucked. No backup, no reinforcements, just a handful of eggheads and whatever guards we can afford. Staying under the radar is our best chance. For now.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_180">
    <text>Why the hell are we stationed at Yantar? It's right next to a psy-emitter and one of the worst mutant hotspots in the Zone. Who thought this was a good idea? Some days, I envy Clear Sky—they've got their swamp hideout, and we're stuck in the goddamn lion's den.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_181">
    <text>I'll never forget the day the Miracle Machine reactivated. We'd just fought off a snork attack, and everyone was either injured or exhausted. Then, out of nowhere, the air went silent, like the world was holding its breath. A low hum started, deep and bone-shaking. Then came the storm—two days of nonstop thunder and lightning. I swear, the Zone was pissed off that day.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_182">
    <text>Lab X-16? Fuck that place. It's a death trap wrapped in a nightmare. I don't care how much they pay—it's not enough. Every time someone goes down there, they either come back broken or don't come back at all. Small wonder we're always short-staffed at Yantar.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_183">
    <text>If I could get a post at Jupiter with Professor Hermann, I'd take it in a heartbeat. No constant zombie swarms, no psy-emitter messing with your head—just proper science. But getting there? That's the catch. Spetsnaz botched the Fairway route, and now helicopters are as rare as a sober stalker.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_184">
    <text>We've spent years studying Yantar and Jupiter, but the rest of the Zone? It's like staring into the abyss. Stalkers pass through with stories of impossible anomalies and artifacts that defy all logic. If even half of it's true, we've barely scratched the surface. God help us.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_185">
    <text>Ever hear the theory that artifacts aren't formed here, but pulled in from another dimension? Sounds crazy, right? But some anomaly behavior during emissions supports it. And those lab documents we've found? They hint at something big—something we're not ready for. The noosphere, parallel dimensions... Who knows what's real anymore?</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_186">
    <text>Sometimes I wonder if we're meant to be here. Not just us scientists, but everyone in the Zone. It feels like a punishment, or maybe a test. The people who created this place left behind their sins, and now we're the ones sifting through the rubble, trying to make sense of it all. Maybe that's our purpose—to clean up their mess.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_187">
    <text>I used to be excited about the Zone's potential. The discoveries, the possibilities... But now? I'm starting to see the darker side. Every breakthrough we make could be turned into a weapon, every artifact into a tool of destruction. The Zone doesn't just test us—it tempts us. And humanity has never been good at resisting temptation.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_188">
    <text>The wildlife here is smarter than it has any right to be. Psy-dogs are practically tactical geniuses compared to regular canines, and even bloodsuckers seem to show a disturbing level of intelligence. Are they just mutations, or is the Zone actively making them smarter? Hell, maybe one day they'll be studying us.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_189">
    <text>The institute's new policy requires all ecologists to be proficient with firearms. Poor Professor Artemyev—he's terrified of guns, jumps at every shot. Failed the exam six times. He's got the brains for the Zone, but not the guts. And without both, you're as good as dead out here.</text>

    <text>Sometimes I think about joining Clear Sky. They seem to get it—using the Zone to learn and adapt, instead of just exploiting it. But their resources are limited, and their leadership isn't exactly inspiring. Still, it's tempting. At least they're not bogged down by politics and red tape like we are.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_191">
    <text>Mercenaries give me the creeps. They're not loyal to anyone but their paycheck, and I've seen them sell out allies for a handful of rubles. If I had to rely on one to save my ass, I'd rather take my chances with the mutants. At least mutants are predictable.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_192">
    <text>Freedom's a bunch of goddamn hippies with guns. Sure, they value the Zone, but they're careless, reckless. They treat artifacts like toys and act like the Zone's some kind of playground. It's not. It's a ticking time bomb, and one day their stupidity's going to blow up in all our faces.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_193">
    <text>Loners are a mixed bag. Some are helpful, others are complete assholes. One saved my life once—shot a bloodsucker right before it pounced on me. But for every hero, there's five idiots who'll sell you out for a half-decent detector. Trust is a luxury most of us can't afford.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_194">
    <text>The Military? A fucking joke. They were sent here to maintain order, and now they're just another gang with better gear. They can't protect us, can't even protect themselves. If the brass back home knew half of what goes on out here, they'd probably nuke the Zone and call it a day.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_195">
    <text>Stay safe, stalker. I've seen too many groups head into the Red Forest or Pripyat thinking they're prepared, only to disappear without a trace. The Zone doesn't care how good your gear is or how many men you've got. Out here, arrogance gets you killed.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_196">
    <text>I don't get you treasure hunters. You risk your life, your sanity, for a chance at riches that might not even exist. If I were you, I'd be looking for the quickest way out of this hellhole. But hey, to each their own. Just don't say I didn't warn you.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_197">
    <text>Clear Sky might be small, but they've got guts. They've been through hell and back, and they're still standing. I respect that. If I can help them out in any way, I will. The Zone could use more people like them—and less like, well, everyone else.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_198">
    <text>Since Clear Sky pulled back their protection services, we've been struggling. Monolith is stronger than ever, zombies are pouring into Yantar, and faction wars are spreading like wildfire. We're stretched thin, and the Zone's not giving us a damn break. We need help—badly.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_199">
    <text>Freedom's leadership doesn't like us much—they think we're too rigid, too “academic.” But we're not here to make friends. Still, if you've got artifacts, bring them by. No hard feelings. Just business.</text>
</string>

	
	<!-- DUTY -->
<string id="dm_information_200">
    <text>You think it's all doom and gloom out here? Well, you're not wrong. The days are long, the food is shit, and every assignment feels like signing your own death warrant. But then I look at the Zone—this cancer on the earth, spewing out mutants, anomalies, and worse. It chews people up and spits them out as nothing but bloody smears on the dirt. That's why I'm here, why I'll keep slinging my shooter till I can't anymore. Someone's gotta fight this mess. What about you? What drives you to risk your life in this hellhole?</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_201">
    <text>Rostok—our fortress in the Zone. It's not perfect, but it's ours. Freedom mocks us, Monolith hates us, and the mutants would love to tear it down to rubble. But we hold the line. This place is more than just a base—it's a symbol. A haven for stalkers who want order and safety, not chaos. And as long as Duty's here, Rostok will stand.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_202">
    <text>People think Rostok is untouchable, but let me tell you—nothing in the Zone ever is. We've spent years combing through vents, sewers, and every inch of the area, trying to seal it off from mutants and those Freedom anarchists. But the Zone has a way of slipping through cracks. Just last month, we found a pack of blind dogs nesting in a drainage tunnel we thought was sealed. Bastards nearly got one of our recruits before we put them down. The work never ends.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_203">
    <text>Close calls are part of life here, but let me tell you about a doozy. Last week, I got separated from my squad during a mutant sweep—fell through the damn forest floor into some godforsaken cave. Before I could even radio for help, I heard growling. Turned around and saw a pseudodog and its pups, snarling like they owned the place. I emptied my Makarov into the big one's face, but those little shits kept coming. Had to use my bayonet to finish the job. When I finally climbed out, I swore I'd never go back there again. Watch your step, stalker—the Zone loves to catch you off guard.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_204">
    <text>Freedom loves to paint themselves as harmless stoners, but don't let that fool you. We caught one sneaking into Rostok last week, carrying plastic explosives and some nasty-looking vials. Biological agents, maybe? Who knows. Make no mistake—those bastards aren't just junkies. They're dangerous, and they'd burn this place to the ground if we gave them the chance.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_205">
    <text>We've been trying to get a couple of old BTRs up and running for years now, but no luck. Doesn't matter how skilled our mechanics are—the Zone has a way of breaking anything more complex than a bolt-action rifle. One day the wiring's fine, the next it's fried for no reason. Sometimes I wonder if the Zone itself hates technology. If we ever get those BTRs working, though, Freedom and the mutants won't know what hit them.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_206">
    <text>Do you have any idea how much worse the Zone would be without Duty? Mutants breed like rats in the far corners, then spread south when the bigger predators chase them out. After one of our sweeps, the piles of dead boars and dogs can be taller than a man. And that's not even counting the horrors lurking in the labs. You think you're safe just because you've got a rifle? Without us, the Zone would drown you in blood and teeth before you could blink.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_207">
    <text>Freedom loves to talk big, but they're useless against Monolith. They've been pushed back so many times they've practically given up on Yanov Station. When we retake it, we'll show those fanatics—and those stoned anarchists—what real discipline looks like. No mercy, no half-measures. Just Duty doing what needs to be done.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_208">
    <text>The Truck Cemetery… You ever been there? Don't. It's a godforsaken pit of rust, radiation, and death. Mutants swarm through the wreckage, bandits lurk in the shadows, and the air itself feels wrong. But it's on our doorstep, so we've got no choice but to patrol it. Every time we send a squad in, there's a good chance they won't come back. If hell exists, it probably looks a lot like that place.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_209">
    <text>There's something new crawling out of the Zone, and it's worse than anything we've seen before. Humanoids that shouldn't exist, shadows that kill without a sound. A buddy of mine—good soldier—was ripped apart by some black cloud in the Wild Territory. Just… gone. Duty's mission has never been more vital. If we don't stop the Zone, it'll swallow us all.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_210">
    <text>Did you know some artifacts might be useful against the Zone? Controllers, for example, reportedly avoid areas with certain types of artifacts. Sounds like bullshit, right? But sometimes I wonder—maybe we could fight fire with fire. Use the Zone's own creations to push it back. It's a long shot, but what else have we got?</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_211">
    <text>I still remember the sound. It was years ago, back when we had a base at Yanov Station. I was pulling guard duty at night when I heard this low, thrumming noise coming from the south. Not an Emission—I know what those sound like. A few minutes later, a squadron of choppers flew overhead, so low I could see the pilots in the cockpit. Turns out it was some military op, but they never made it back. Helicopters don't belong in the north—nothing does.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_212">
    <text>There's a pattern to the mutant attacks on Rostok. They're not random. The packs always strike during shift changes or meal breaks, when we're least prepared. And it's not just dogs—there's always a few nastier ones mixed in, ones we don't usually see around here. I'm telling you, it's psy-dogs. They're getting smarter, learning how to hit us where it hurts. Makes you wonder what else the Zone is teaching them.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_213">
    <text>Duty doesn't just sit around waiting for trouble to find us. We send recon teams deep into the Zone to track the movements of mutants, Monolith, and even Freedom. It's dangerous work—most of them never come back. But it's the only way we can stay one step ahead. Without intel, we're as good as dead.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_214">
    <text>Don't let your guard down, stalker. The Zone has a way of lulling you into a false sense of security, then gutting you when you least expect it. I've seen it happen to too many people—friends, comrades. Some of them are buried out back, but most? Most just disappeared, swallowed whole by this cursed place.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_215">
    <text>The Zone is alive. I know how that sounds, but it's true. You can feel it—something watching, waiting, biding its time. It's not just anomalies or mutants. There's something deeper, something we don't understand. And one day, it's going to show itself. God help us when it does.</text>
</string>

<string id="dm_information_216">
    <text>Bandits are crawling all over the Garbage again, preying on rookies and raiding stashes. It's high time we swept through and reminded those bastards who's in charge. They think they're untouchable, hiding among the trash and muck, but Duty doesn't forget. A few well-placed patrols, and we'll clean them out like the vermin they are.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_217">
    <text>They're working me to the bone out here—mutant sweeps, patrol duty, scouting runs, rinse and repeat. Barely get a moment to breathe before the next assignment comes down. Sometimes I wonder if the brass are trying to break me, but you know what? Let them try. I'm still standing, and I'll keep standing as long as it takes to see this mission through.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_218">
    <text>Duty doesn't tolerate weakness. Every morning, we're up for drills—running, shooting, survival exercises. No drugs, no gorging on rations, none of that Freedom bullshit. Zulu couldn't hack it, and he bailed, but the rest of us? We're here because we've got the discipline to survive and fight another day. That's what separates us from the chaos out there.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_219">
    <text>Two years ago, I was part of a long-range patrol near Pripyat. We picked up a distress signal from an apartment block—sounded like a group of loners in over their heads. We decided to check it out, but when we got there… it wasn't loners. Monolith ambush. They hit us hard, but we managed to fight them off. Found a rigged explosive near the entrance—lucky it didn't go off. Turns out the signal was bait. They'd tortured some poor bastard into broadcasting it. That's Monolith for you—zealots who'll kill themselves just to take you down with them.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_220">
    <text>Freedom sees beauty in the Zone? What a joke. I've seen what this place does to people. The radiation, the mutants, the anomalies—it doesn't create beauty. It destroys, warps, corrupts. Freedom's just too high to notice. Maybe if they spent a day in my boots, burying comrades who got chewed up by bloodsuckers or crushed by anomalies, they'd stop romanticizing this hellhole.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_221">
    <text>Duty's been around longer than most people realize. We started as a group of soldiers who saw the Zone for what it really is—a threat to all humanity. We couldn't sit by and do nothing, so we left the army and formed Duty. Our mission is clear: fight the Zone, protect the innocent, and keep this madness contained. Sure, we've made mistakes—what faction hasn't? But we're still here, still fighting. That's what matters.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_222">
    <text>Wouldn't it be great if the Bandits and Freedom just wiped each other out? Solve half our problems right there. But no, those degenerates seem to get along just fine. Birds of a feather, I guess. Still, one day we'll deal with both of them. Just a matter of time.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_223">
    <text>Kamarov's squad went missing a couple of weeks ago during a patrol near the Red Forest. Most of the guys have written them off as dead, but I'm not so sure. Kamarov's tough, one of the best. If anyone could survive out there, it's him. I keep hoping he'll show up one day, battered but alive. Until then, all we can do is wait and pray.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_224">
    <text>Forget Pripyat—Red Forest is the real breeding ground for mutants. That place is crawling with horrors, and I don't just mean the ones you can see. There are tunnels, caves, things moving in the shadows that no one's lived to describe. If you ever go out there, make sure your will's in order first.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_225">
    <text>You ever hear the stories about stalkers who leave the Zone? They say the Zone doesn't let you go—not really. Disasters, freak accidents, bad luck—it follows them, like a curse. Makes you wonder if the Zone isn't just a place, but something alive. Something that wants to spread. We don't even understand the half of it yet.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_226">
    <text>Wild Territory is a meat grinder. Mutants swarm it like flies on a corpse, and the Mercs? They'll shoot you on sight just for stepping into their so-called turf. It's a slaughterhouse, plain and simple. If you've got any sense, you'll stay the hell away. If you don't, well… good luck.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_227">
    <text>A couple of months ago, one of our squads stumbled across an old Soviet fallout shelter near Agroprom. It was stocked with rations, gear, even a few working rifles. The food tastes like cardboard, but it's better than starving. We're still cataloging the place—it's like a time capsule from the Cold War. Amazing what you can find in this cursed place.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_228">
    <text>One day, Monolith is going to make a push south. When that day comes, it'll be up to Duty to hold the line. We're not as big as we used to be, but we're still strong. And when those fanatics come for Rostok, we'll make them pay for every inch. They'll have to kill every last one of us to take this place—and I guarantee we'll take plenty of them with us.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_229">
    <text>As crazy as it sounds, I wouldn't want to be anywhere else. Duty's mission is the right one. We're fighting to protect humanity, to stop the Zone from spreading its corruption. Sure, it's dangerous, and yeah, it's probably going to get me killed. But at least I'll die knowing I made a difference. That's more than most people can say.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_230">
    <text>Word is, we're gearing up to hit Freedom where it hurts. Petrenko says we've got a plan to take them down a peg, maybe even push them out of the Army Warehouses. It's about time we reminded those stoners who's really in charge around here.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_231">
    <text>What's the deal with that scumbag Arnie and his underground fight club? How the hell does Voronin let that happen in Duty territory? It's a disgrace, plain and simple. Duty stands for order and discipline, not that kind of lawless crap. Makes me sick just thinking about it.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_232">
    <text>You hear about the rookie who stole Aspirin's medical booze? Thought he could smuggle it out to his loner buddies. Gavrilenko beat the piss out of him for it—left him barely standing. Not sure what's going to happen to him now, but I doubt he'll be stealing anything else anytime soon.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_233">
    <text>I'd tell you about the new locking systems we're installing, but, well… you're not exactly authorized for that. Let's just say Duty's security is about to get even tighter. We're not taking any chances—not with Freedom, not with Monolith, not with anyone.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_234">
    <text>The eggheads gave us bad intel on a mutant nest last week. Nearly got half my squad killed. I'm done trusting anyone outside of Duty. They might have their uses, but when push comes to shove, it's our men who bleed and die out there, not theirs.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_235">
    <text>We're rolling out new recon maps soon. They're supposed to account for known anomalies, mutant territories, and hostile factions. About time, too—our patrols have been walking blind for too long. With these maps, our men can move faster and safer, and that makes all the difference out here.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_236">
    <text>Ever hear about Shulga? He was one of Duty's best, back in the day. Nobody really knows what happened to him. Some say he went rogue, others think he's dead. Me? I think he's still out there, watching, waiting for the right moment to come back. If you're curious, ask Gavrilenko—he's got stories that'll curl your hair.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_237">
    <text>Chimera sightings near the NPP have spiked recently. Our deep-recon teams are keeping an eye on them, but let's hope they stay up there. Last thing we need is those freaks wandering down south, tearing through everything in their path.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_238">
    <text>Petrenko mentioned that one of our ammo shipments went missing near Agroprom. Probably Bandits or Mercs. Either way, you might want to double-check your mags before heading out. No point going into a firefight with an empty rifle.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_239">
    <text>The Bar's been attracting all sorts of strange types lately. Loners headed for the deep north, Clear Sky out of their swamps, even some hooded bastards who slip away in the dead of night. Feels like something's brewing, but damned if I know what.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_240">
    <text>Spent some time with the Loners at Skadovsk a while back. Good people, mostly, but they don't really get it. To them, the Zone's just a playground—a place to get rich or find adventure. They don't see the bigger picture. Some of them wise up eventually, and when they do, they join Duty. Those are the ones who survive.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_241">
    <text>We've got a good relationship with the Free Stalkers. They watch our backs, we watch theirs. If it weren't for Duty, the center of the Zone would be overrun by Bandits and Monolith. Instead, it's a place where people can trade, rest, and plan their next move. That's what we're fighting for—stability, order, and a chance for people to live without constant fear.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_242">
    <text>What do I think of Clear Sky? Honestly, they're a bit of a mystery to me. They keep to themselves, mostly. I've seen a few of their guys in the Bar—they're quiet, polite, don't cause any trouble. I guess I can respect that, but I can't shake the feeling they're hiding something. Nobody stays that low-key in the Zone without a reason.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_243">
    <text>We used to do joint ops with the Military sometimes. Clearing out mutants, taking down Bandit hideouts, stuff like that. Hell, we even backed them up during a couple of operations near the NPP. Lately, though, everyone's been too busy dealing with their own problems. Shame, really—we could use some of that firepower right about now.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_244">
    <text>Whenever we find artefacts, we hand them over to the eggheads. They're supposed to figure out how to use them against the Zone, but I'm starting to wonder if they're just playing with their new toys. Better them than Freedom, though. Last thing we need is those idiots selling artefacts to the highest bidder without a second thought.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_245">
    <text>What's up with the Mercs and the Wild Territory? They're obsessed with that place, always fighting to keep control of it. Doesn't make much sense to me—it's a shithole, full of mutants and anomalies. Let them have it, I say. Not like we're losing anything valuable by leaving it to those cutthroats.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_246">
    <text>Mercenaries are a real wildcard in the Zone. Nobody knows who they're working for or what their goals are, and that makes them dangerous. They'll sell their services to anyone with enough cash, whether it's Bandits, eggheads, or Monolith cultists. If you see one, don't trust them—and if you can, avoid them altogether.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_247">
    <text>Ever thought about joining Duty? We're always looking for people with guts and a good head on their shoulders. It's not just about holding a rifle—it's about being part of something bigger. A cause. A mission. If you're tired of wandering aimlessly and want to make a real difference, think it over. We could use someone like you.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_248">
    <text>Some people call us fascists. I call that bullshit. We're here to stop the Zone from spreading, to protect innocent lives. Bandits, Monolith, Freedom—they're all part of the problem. Bandits prey on the weak, Monolith worships the Zone like it's a god, and Freedom's reckless ideology only fuels the chaos. Duty stands for order, discipline, and survival. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_249">
    <text>Is it true Sakharov experiments on live subjects? I've heard some wild rumors about him testing artefacts on people, but who knows what's true in this place? Still, wouldn't surprise me if some of those eggheads have crossed a line or two. The Zone does strange things to people, even the smartest ones.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_250">
    <text>You ever think about how these mutants keep popping up? I mean, boars and dogs, sure, they breed like normal animals. But bloodsuckers? Chimeras? Where the hell do they come from? The labs, maybe, or something worse. Honestly, I'm not sure I want to know. Some questions are better left unanswered in the Zone.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_251">
    <text>What's your deal, stalker? You here to trade, drink, or stir up trouble? Just know this: Rostok is under Duty's protection. We don't tolerate chaos here. Keep that in mind, and you'll get along just fine.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_252">
    <text>Ever heard of a guy named Abakumin? Used to serve in the army with me years ago. Said he'd join Duty someday, but I haven't seen or heard from him since. Last I knew, he was stationed near Agroprom. Wonder if he's still out there, or if the Zone finally got him.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_253">
    <text>Saw one of your helis flying over the Garbage the other day. What are you guys up to? Duty could use some of that air support, you know. Then again, if the rumors are true about your birds… maybe it's better we stick to the ground. Don't need any extra Zone-related surprises.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_254">
    <text>Sidorovich is still kicking, huh? Fat bastard's probably richer than ever. Haven't dealt with him in years—not since he sold me a batch of vodka so watered-down it might as well have been tap water. Still, he's reliable in his own scummy way. Guess that counts for something out here.</text>
</string>

	
	<!-- MILITARY -->
<string id="dm_information_255">
    <text>What do you think of this assignment? Here's the reality: we're woefully ill-equipped for what the Zone throws at us. Back when it all started, we had proper reinforcements, cutting-edge equipment, even decent food supplies. Now, it's like they're deliberately setting us up to fail. They hand you a second-hand rifle that jams if you look at it wrong, a summer uniform that doesn't stop the cold or radiation, and a can of expired bread. "Now go fight mutants, criminals, and anomalies that defy physics," they say. Oh, and try not to step into that shimmery patch of air. You'll lose your legs—if you're lucky, just your legs.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_256">
    <text>I'll admit it, I signed up for this voluntarily. Life in the reserves was dull—endless drills, nothing to look forward to. I thought the Zone would be different, exciting even. And it is, but not in the way I imagined. It's chaos out here. Just last week, my squad went on four different raids: bandits in Garbage, mutant nests in Dark Valley, and a botched recon into Pripyat. We lost people each time, but there's no chance to mourn. Things happen fast here. Too fast.</text>
</string>

<string id="dm_information_257">
    <text>You ever wonder who gets sent to the Zone? I'll tell you. The brass uses this place as a dumping ground for people they want out of the way. Got a soldier who doesn't follow orders? Off to the Zone. A squad that embarrasses their CO? Zone. It's a punishment detail disguised as a deployment. The only exception is those Spetsnaz psychos. They come here willingly, and they thrive. God knows how or why.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_258">
    <text>It's hard not to think about what could've been. If we'd acted decisively when the Zone first appeared, maybe we wouldn't be in this mess. Imagine: secure borders, the anomalies contained, and all we'd have to do is guard the perimeter. Instead, the Zone grew while we fumbled around like idiots. Now it feels like we're an occupying force in someone else's territory—except the 'someone' is a living, breathing nightmare that doesn't want us here. Meanwhile, stalkers act like they own the place. It's maddening.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_259">
    <text>My father was a soldier too. He fought in Afghanistan and died in a vehicle ambush. I used to think he had it rough, but the shit we face here? It makes Afghanistan look like a vacation. Last month, an entire squad got wiped out in Dark Valley by bloodsuckers. They didn't stand a chance—picked off one by one in the pitch black. Sometimes I think about my dad and wonder what he'd make of this. Would he have been able to survive it? I doubt it.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_260">
    <text>If there's one thing that makes this hellhole worth it, it's the sound of a gunship clearing the skies. A few weeks ago, we spotted a massive horde of zombies shambling through Wild Territory. We radioed it in, and within minutes, the chopper arrived. Rockets streaked through the sky, the cannon ripped through the air, and the entire horde was obliterated in seconds. It was glorious—briefly made me forget where we were. Until the next nightmare showed up, of course.</text>
</string>

    <text>The brass wants every squad to have someone trained to use anomaly detectors now. As if we didn't already have enough on our plates. It's not enough to dodge bullets and outrun mutants—now we have to worry about invisible death traps that can fry you, crush you, or turn you inside out. This should be a scientist's job, not ours. But the Zone doesn't care about shoulds, does it?</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_262">
    <text>You know, the Zone isn't always terrible. Sometimes, when you're sitting around a campfire with your squad inside the safety of Agroprom's walls, it almost feels normal. Almost. But the moment you step outside, the Zone reminds you what it really is—a waking nightmare. And nightmares don't let you rest for long.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_263">
    <text>Corruption? It's rampant. You've got patrols taking bribes to let stalkers through, officers selling artefacts on the black market, even some guys working with Mercs or Bandits. It's a disgrace. But what do you expect? The Zone brings out the worst in people. It's not just the mutants that'll get you—it's your own so-called comrades. Trust no one.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_264">
    <text>Monolith. The word alone makes my skin crawl. When I first got stationed here, I thought we'd be dealing with petty criminals and scavengers. Nobody told me about a battalion of brainwashed zealots armed to the teeth and hell-bent on killing anything that isn't them. They don't retreat, they don't surrender, and they sure as hell don't miss. Every time we encounter them, we lose more men. And the scariest part? They're getting stronger.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_265">
    <text>I've seen combat before—Chechnya, back in the day. Thought I'd seen it all. Then I came to the Zone. This place is something else entirely. It doesn't matter how tough or experienced you are—the Zone breaks you. I've seen guys who've been through hell shoot themselves just to get out of here. And honestly? I can't say I blame them.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_266">
    <text>The Zone is too big, too dangerous for us to control completely. So we hold what we can—strategic locations like Agroprom, the Cordon, and a few outposts in the north. But even those are tenuous. Every day feels like a holding action, a desperate attempt to maintain what little ground we have. We're not winning this war. We're just trying to survive it.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_267">
    <text>You ever hear of Rogovets? Quiet guy, keeps to himself. But don't let that fool you—he's a legend. Survived Operation Fairway, fought alongside Kovalsky in Pripyat, even met Strelok himself. If you ever get the chance, ask him about it. His stories will make your hair stand on end.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_268">
    <text>Sgt. Spooner's the kind of guy you want on your side. Runs the supply depot at Agroprom, but he's got his fingers in all sorts of pies. Rumor has it he's in contact with some Military Stalkers operating deep in the Zone. If you ever need something—ammo, intel, even a favor—he's the man to see. Just don't cross him. He didn't earn his reputation by being nice.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_269">
    <text>Monolith encounters? Let me give you some advice: avoid them. You're on patrol, everything's quiet, then suddenly—gunfire, explosions, and those chilling chants. "The will of the Monolith commands you to die," they say, over and over. They don't stop, they don't falter, and they don't run out of ammo. It's like fighting ghosts. If you're smart, you'll run the other way. If you're lucky, you might survive.</text>
</string>
	<string id="dm_information_270">
		<text>How far have you been towards the center of the Zone? Seems to get worse the further in you go. First, you only have to deal with little loners and petty bandits. Further, you run across the permanent battlefield of the organized factions: Mercs, Duty and the anarchists. After that... it's pretty much monsters and fanatics all the way to the plant. I wonder what's up there. Nothing good, obviously. The Zone gets more pure as you go further in, and more evil. The center's got to be the most pure and evil of all.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_271">
		<text>Out of all the places I've been, I think I hate the Swamps the most. There are other areas with more dangerous activities, more lead in the air... but that swamp is just cursed or something. I think there's more there than any of us know, lurking under the water and in the rushes, sleeping... That's aside from the fighting itself. Yeah, give me a patrol in the Garbage or Dark Valley any day.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_272">
		<text>I was in a squad with a corporal a couple years back; this guy was a real son of a bitch, more of a scumbag than any bandit I've ever met. I remember we were on a patrol in the Dark Valley and we suddenly were fired upon by one guy, real erratic and ineffective. We caught him, and he was just some little rookie, fresh from the Cordon with some worthless trinkets in his bag; he'd seen our patrol and panicked, letting off his pistol as he tried to run away. Well anyway, this corporal had been winged by one of his shots, it hardly grazed it skin. Well, this is what he did: when we got back to the base over X-18, the captain wanted to see the prisoner we took, but we couldn't find him, we just assumed he had seen a chance and bolted. A couple days later, someone asked the corporal about it and he answered, very casually, that he thrown the rookie into the lab and locked the door. We found his corpse, clinging to the handle with the most horrifying look on his face...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_273">
		<text>You need someone to watch your back out there. You've probably seen the corpses: spread out on the floor, skin's all pale and grey, nasty marks on the back of the neck. That's how I found my buddy after we had just arrived in the Zone: I couldn't see anything in the dark, just heard this slobbering sound and then two eyes looked up at me. bloodsuckers. You can never tell when they're around.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_274">
		<text>Pripyat: the city of silence, the city of graveyards. Every time we go that way, the Zone spits us back out. I can only hope that we've learned our lesson: we're not meant to be there.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_275">
		<text>Weird to say, as hellish as it is here, some guys just thrive for some reason. Some of them are field-appointed to Spetsnaz and go on deep-recon, infiltration or special mutant hunts. Others become those "Military Stalkers": not really army any more, but given greater autonomy because of their usefulness. They've got to be the strangest of all; the Zone is their home now. They seem to all have some sort of special sense or instinct, maybe it has something to do with those psy-waves we're always getting warned about.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_276">
		<text>I should have been a psychologist. It would have been worth it just to answer one question: why the hell do people come here? People that come here get horribly mutilated, irradiated, extorted, enslaved, betrayed and inevitably murdered in some horrible way. What's the point? Some quick money? Hell, why don't you just rob a bank? It would be so much better than trying to get here. So, here we are, trying to clean up after these fruitcakes that have elected to die horribly. How about we just all go home, eh? I'll drive the bus.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_277">
		<text>Ever hear whispering when you're all alone? Well, either it's schizophrenia, or there's one of those Controller things nearby. We used to have a problem with violence and suicides in one of the barracks. Then we found a sort of nest thing right outside the walls in some underbrush. Fucking Controllers.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_278">
		<text>Ok, want some spooky shit? Well here it is: One night I was keeping watch for our squad because we got lost somewhere, uh, south of Pripyat... anyway, that's not the point. I'm just sitting there as my comrades sleep, and I'm wide awake and looking out for danger. Then, soundlessly and out of nowhere, there's a chopper in the valley in front of me. I just sat there blinking. Like I said: no sound at all, no rotors or anything. It touches down and the bay doors open up and a bunch of military guys get out; they look like Spetsnaz. They seem to notice me and one guy walks forward, waving his hand in greeting - obviously, I'm frozen solid. Then he takes off his helmet... and there's nothing there! I jump to my feet and the whole scene just sorts of fades away, blurs out. I woke up my buddies, but they didn't believe me. What do you think about it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_279">
		<text>Same old story. Some fat general outside complains about the situation in the Zone that he's never been within 50 kilometers of. The whole chain of command gets squeezed until some lieutenant is forced to order a suicide mission into completely unknown territory. Some unwitting grunts are sent packing and get promptly massacred by beasts or lunatics. Usually, survivors come back and describe the futility of the op. And repeat.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_280">
		<text>Want to see what the Zone has in store for you? Look at the snork. Snorks were once soldiers, but they've been twisted and perverted into what they are now: soldiers of the Zone. Stay here long enough and we'll be just like them.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_281">
		<text>If you ever need your kit looked at, drop in to see Lt. Kirilov. That guy is some kind of miracle worker; from radios to light machine guns, he's your man.</text> 
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_282">
		<text>Don't get on Kuznetsov's bad side, ok? Your life will suddenly become very unpleasant. Like that one sergeant, uh... Urianov. I've been told his new assignment is running messages in the Swamps.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_283">
		<text>When in doubt, shoot. If you see movement out in the Zone, don't fucking wait a minute. I've seen some guys hesitate and die. Sometimes its Mercs or lunatics, but a Chimera can kill you just as quickly as bullets. Just light up anything you see.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_284">
		<text>Our commanding officers are a joke. Any stalker who wants to get into the Zone just needs to ask for the commander and flash some rubles. Not even that much. Then it's up to us to clean it up.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_285">
		<text>Better to stay on your CO's good side, otherwise you might get "accidentally" lost to the Zone. And if you've got a real bastard over you, your days are numbered. Back years ago when we were heavily involved in fighting against the organized groups, I've heard the practice of extreme discipline was in effect. That murderous bastard Khaletskiy had soldiers executed if you didn't do what your captain told you. There's a pretty situation! Plunge into the irradiated hellscape of the Zone, with a gun barrel and killer mutant behind each tree, or get a pistol shot to the back of the head.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_286">
		<text>Did you ever meet Kovalsky? Yeah, I did once. Honestly, he was a really solid guy; he cared about his men and they worked their asses off for him. What happened to him just shows how shitty things are.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_287">
		<text>When are we going to do something about those tunnels under Agroprom? You know its full of bandits and mutants down there? What happens when they come calling in the middle of the night? Hell, I don't want to go down there; let's just gas the place or something.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_288">
		<text>They ever tell you about Zaton? Well, its the marshy remains of a lake way up north. We used to have a presence there, until we lost contact with a convoy of vehicles. It never seems to work out with mechanized transport, its just like broadcasting a message to the Zone: "Please direct your anomalies, emissions and mindless horrors here!" Just like many other places, we had to pull out.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_289">
		<text>What the hell is up with those anomalies, anyway? Where do they come from? Why can't the eggheads figure them out? Do they grow, are they alive? I'm a soldier: I've gotten used to dealing with being shot at. But nobody told me about this sort of thing... whatever it is.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_290">
		<text>It's us against them. They don't want us here, we don't want them here. I guess some of those Duty guys are alright, but you can never tell. One of these days, those reinforcements are going to come and we're going to sweep all the way to the power plant.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_291">
		<text>You can't even breathe here; the air's all filled with radiation and toxins and God knows what else. I feel like I'm being strangled over time... just awful. Well, what is it, anyway?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_292">
		<text>Kuznetsov wouldn't hesitate to use you as a human shield to save his own ass. How many people do you think he has sent to their deaths just to get where he is now? You know, one time there was an attempt to... well, I shouldn't be talking about it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_293">
		<text>We're fighting in a graveyard man, look around. Rusting shells of APCs, smashed trucks, wrecked choppers... they all tell a tale. That's aside from the human corpses, a lot of which are up and walking around. I wonder if we'll join them...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_294">
		<text>A lot of guys say it's pointless here - I don't. I used to think that, until I saw what the Monolith could do. What happens when they start spreading outside the Zone? Who's going to stop them? The stalkers? Right... We've got to stay and fight. We've got to.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_295">
		<text>Hey, how's Peregrine doing up there in Yantar? We could use more dependable guys like that around here. Didn't talk too much either.</text> 
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_296">
		<text>Nice to see someone who's actually supposed to be here. These days, there's more stalkers in the Zone than authorized personnel.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_297">
		<text>Gone native, eh? That's alright in my book. We need some guys working the Zone from the inside, too.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_298">
		<text>I heard that Kuznetsov wanted to position some Spetsnaz advisors in the Duty ranks. Can't imagine that would go over too well with you guys.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_299">
		<text>You just watch yourself. Just because we've got a truce doesn't mean we're friends.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_300">
		<text>Don't be fooled by the Clear Sky faction, they've proven their hostility over and again. What do they even do in their little swamp lair? Where do their allegiances lie?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_301">
		<text>We've got some ties to Duty. Among the stalker population here, they're the most level-headed. We don't mid helping them out when we can.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_302">
		<text>Mercs are some nasty customers. If even half the things they say about them are true, you don't want to get mixed up with them. They're trying to set up their little kingdom in the Zone, and they'd rather not have the army in their way.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_303">
		<text>Don't buy into the Freedom bullshit. The Zone isn't your friend, and neither are they. The only thing those dopefiend anarchists care about is demolishing any barriers between the horrors of the Zone and the rest of the world.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_304">
		<text>Loners are entirely deluded. They come here looking for riches, but they don't realize that they're only the grist for the mill. Stalkers go in, zombies, fanatics and corpses come out. Keeping naive loners out of the Zone is an act of mercy.</text>
	</string>
	
	<!-- CLEAR SKY -->
	<string id="dm_information_305">
		<text>The other factions are fumbling around in the Zone; some hate it, some idolize it, but none of them really know what the Zone is all about. Clear Sky is closer than any. We've been at this for a long time, and we can't let the best shot of fixing the Zone die out because some violent shitheads can't understand that.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_306">
		<text>If Clear Sky's going to survive, we need to pull together and seek partnerships with our allies. Unfortunately, sometimes it seems like everyone is out to get us...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_307">
		<text>The Great Swamp, despite being a lair for the lowest of the low, is actually a very good place for study. Privacy wasn't the only factor in choosing our headquarters; the Swamp also furnishes a plethora of biological specimens and holds a variety of different anomalies. There may be more extreme conditions near the center of the Zone, but they can't be researched with the same level of rigor.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_308">
		<text>Some of us are tasked with securing the perimeter of our territory, but we also require teams who go out into the farther reaches of the Zone in order to take various readings and report on the validity of research opportunities elsewhere.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_309">
		<text>Cold has been a very able leader for us, even though he was a bit under-qualified to take the position. Many of us put forward Kalancha for the post, but he declined. In retrospect, I suppose that was a good choice; Doctor Kalancha is, really, too noble for all this fighting.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_310">
		<text>What happened with the Zone was a tragedy. If we could have simply united as a group and addressed the problem at hand, we could have contained the Zone as well as deriving benefit from it. As it stands, greed and stupidity reigns. The Zone is a land of corpses.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_311">
		<text>Careful experimentation is always difficult in the middle of a firefight. For a long time, we've acknowledged that the fate of our mission is tied to the life of the Zone, that we cannot be detached observers. In a way, our military objectives have as much to do with the containment of the Zone as our research programs.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_312">
		<text>I joined up because I saw the futility of staying with the Free Stalkers; I saw that a concentrated effort is needed to understand the Zone. I'm not much of a scientist, really... but we need shooters too.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_313">
		<text>We're always in need of more equipment, so we end up making much of it ourselves. Novikov is absolutely brilliant with this, I have no idea where he gets the material, but he's always creating protective suits and comms equipment out of nothing at all.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_314">
		<text>The Swamps are not as dangerous as some places, but never get comfortable. I was heading back from the watchtower one evening when I heard something that sounded like a feeble moan of pain. I pushed through the reeds and saw a body face-down - looked like a loner. I turned him over and it became clear that he had been dead for weeks. I hear a noise and look up to see half a dozen pairs of eyes in the rushes all around me. If it wasn't for some quick moves and a chance patrol that was passing by, I think I would have been the next lure.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_315">
		<text>Every casualty is a big hit for us, so we've opted for caution and stealth as a strategy. Obviously, we don't exactly have manpower flooding in all the time. It wasn't always so...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_316">
		<text>I'd contend that we have the best artefact hunters in the entire Zone. Most people would think the Ecologists, but we've got some guys who live and breath in anomaly fields. While we may not have the most up-to-date tech or steady funding, we have more experience with artefacts than anyone.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_317">
		<text>Radiation poisoning is not too fun, so be careful where you step. Structures and standing water is dangerous, especially without a closed-cycle respirator. But the worst is not realizing that you've been torched to hell until your buddy's detector goes off. We had to evac one of our guys out of the Zone once, I never heard if he made it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_318">
		<text>I had some friends who went with that Mercenary to the NPP. I actually really wanted to go, but I was recovering from an infected bite, so they made me stay. Then, they all died. I stayed at the Skadovsk for awhile until Nimble let me know that Clear Sky wasn't dead. We're not putting any more of our trust into miracle-workers like Scar.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_319">
		<text>I know one of Professor Kalancha's tests just determined that flesh DNA is a composite of several different species. Before you ask, yes: there's a little bit of human mixed up in there somehow. They always did give me the creeps.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_320">
		<text>There's all sorts of creepy shit you can hear over the radio. For one thing, I know someone in the Zone is using a numbers station - probably the army. Besides that, I once heard the civilian radios of Pripyat during the nuclear disaster! It's like something in the Zone stores up those signals and lets them bounce around every so often. You should talk to Novikov, he's heard more than I have.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_321">
		<text>The rise of the Monolith is worrying. We caught the first blow of it when Lebedev and the assault force were lost, but God only knows how strong they are now. They're appearing further and further south all the time; soon, they'll be in the Swamps as well.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_322">
		<text>I think that our greatest asset is not in weapons or strongholds, but in the database of information that we've been working on for over a decade. I wouldn't doubt that the secret to containing the Zone, the blowouts, the Monolith - all of it, might be found in the research we've accumulated. Even if the faction doesn't survive, I hope that someone wise comes into possession of our work.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_323">
		<text>The optical camouflage of the bloodsucker has long been an enigma and a very attractive goal for our bio-engineers. But for the time being, I don't think we'll be seeing any invisible stalkers wreaking havoc in the Zone. Getting those biological samples is hard enough; we're usually not thinking about preservation when we get attacked by a real-life vampire.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_324">
		<text>Life with Clear Sky is like Nehemiah: shovel in one hand and sword in another. I guess that'd be... detector in one hand, shooter in the other.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_325">
		<text>Cold thinks that someone in the base is ratting us out. We've detected some radio transmissions in the middle of the night that we can't identify and they appear to be encoded. We might be getting some new security measures soon.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_326">
		<text>Spore stays in touch with Nimble, who is a really good stream of information from the north. Well he just told me that Nimble is reporting an increase in activity in his region: sensors are picking up more mutant movements, anomaly changes and even emission strength - something's brewing up there.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_327">
		<text>How much blood has been shed over that shitty pump station? I don't even get it: what's it for? who built it? I wish it would just fall apart already.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_328">
		<text>We've got some real old-timers with us, but they're becoming more and more scarce. In fact, I remember some stalkers who got into the Zone working for the ISG! I think they probably died out with Lebedev, though.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_329">
		<text>Ever see the swamp doctor? He lives by the smashed railway bridge like a hermit. I saw him one night wandering around; he scared the shit out of me. It was like he was sleepwalking too. Well... I hear he's harmless.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_330">
		<text>A Gauss rifle is what we need - or maybe a dozen. The odds are against us and we're getting pushed more and more all the time. We need something to turn the tide. Maybe we could ask the Monolith to lend us one.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_331">
		<text>Clear Sky is fortunate to get committed stalkers in its ranks, but we've had our scumbags too. You probably heard about that guy named Buzzard who snatched some artefacts from the lab and defected; we had heard that he was snitching for the Military. Turns out, we identified his body among some Renegade thugs we bagged the other day. What a piece of work.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_332">
		<text>The view from the Old Church is wonderful, almost makes the Great Swamp seem peaceful and natural. Going up there and taking off my mask... my head feels clearer than anywhere else in the Zone. I think it is a holy place. Laugh if you want.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_333">
		<text>Cold's been talking to me about forming some sort of pact with Loners, either Beard or Barkeep. We always need more help, and some more intel couldn't hurt, but some in the leadership are very wary of Free Stalkers.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_334">
		<text>Just be careful who you're talking to out there. Our situation calls for discretion and there are plenty of unscrupulous assholes out there would sell intel to our enemies for few rubles. Practice silence and refrain from drinking with outsiders.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_335">
		<text>Man, Professor Kalancha's getting old. One day, he'll be gone. Who's going to fill that place? All the greats are dead and buried.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_336">
		<text>I think I would be much more content if the food situation was better. There's lots of ways to prepare "local cuisine", but I'm just so sick of it all. Give me real food and hold the rads, please.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_337">
		<text>Another shipment of Veles detectors got stolen en route. At this rate, we'll be searching for artefacts with divining rods.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_338">
		<text>Some stalker in the Bar told me that the Military is sending in operatives to infiltrate all of the major factions. Should we be worried? You know how much they want to end us.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_339">
		<text>How long do you think we can hold out, really? I know some of the guys are saying that the situation is stabilizing, but I don't see it. The army is always tightening in on us and the thugs are never short of fighters. If they took the base, where would we go then? I'm not sure if we could survive another diaspora.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_340">
		<text>Duty and Freedom have got it all wrong. The Zone isn't something to be "for" or "against", but something to understand and contain. These sort of emotional reactions led us all into trouble.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_341">
		<text>We certainly appreciate the Ecologists' quest for knowledge, but I'm not sure if they understand that the Zone is not just a bank of data to take withdrawals from. On the other hand, I've met some scientists who are invested in the happenings within the Zone.</text>

		<text>The army seems little better than the bandits it claims to fight. It wouldn't surprise me if they recruited from Sultan's thugs.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_343">
		<text>If only a fifth of unaffiliated stalkers could be convinced of the need for concentrated study and containment of the Zone we could double our numbers.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_344">
		<text>Maybe the Loners would have more of a chance if that creep Sidorovich didn't make a habit out of filling the heads of rookies with fairytale bullshit before sending them out to die.</text>

	<string id="dm_information_345">
		<text>Clear Sky is always looking for more artefact equipment, so do let Sakharov know that we have research to offer in exchange.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_346">
		<text>If you happen to travel up to Zaton, let Beard know that we're interested in any unusual artefacts that he has. It's been a while since we've had a deal with him.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_347">
		<text>Be careful about what you're sticking on your belt, ok? These artefacts have more properties than just radiation, so you need to treat them carefully. I've seen a stalker just burst into flames because his artefacts reacted with eachother.</text>

	<string id="dm_information_348">
		<text>If you see Barman, tell him that I've almost completed the business we were discussing. He'll know what I mean.</text>

		<text>I doubt I'd have any information that you would be interested in - only happenings in the south. Must seem fairly unimportant to you all; you have your own problems.</text>

	<!-- FREEDOM -->
	<string id="dm_information_350">
		<text>There's just nothing like the Zone, bro. Have you ever just seen the sky after an emission... the feeling of cool wind and a peace in the air... shit, I could write some poetry on that.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_351">
		<text>Now, I'm not saying there's not any nuts in Freedom, ok? Like those two Czech guys who are committed vegetarians and pacifists. C'mon man, have you ever seen one of those fucked-up man-eating cats? I bet those two have never been out of the base.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_352">
		<text>What's with all this discipline and control shit anyway? We need to make sure that the organization of Freedom stays true to its roots: liberty and free expression. I thought we were fighting the fascists, not inviting them in...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_353">
		<text>Some stalkers think that the Zone just provides a release to their violent tendencies. Like those assholes who go around shooting birds or dog pups... what's wrong with some people?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_354">
		<text>The best thing about Freedom is that we're all brothers here. There's no sad imitation of the army thugs here: "Yes sir, no sir" bullshit. No, we actually look out for each-other because we care, not because some stuck-up prick tells us to.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_355">
		<text>Yeah, I know all of the jokes, but don't treat bloodsuckers lightly. More than one a couple of cocky rookies wandered off into the abandoned village and were never seen again. Well, they were never seen again in one piece.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_356">
		<text>I like to think of the Warehouses as the happy little center of the Zone. Duty comes up from Rostok, Mercs come in from Dead City, loonies come down from Radar, bloodsuckers in the west, visitors from Red Forest in the north and we're in the south. The center, you can imagine, is quite a busy place.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_357">
		<text>The fascists might be on the defensive, but don't underestimate them yet. They've still got enough frustrated anger to be a nuisance.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_358">
		<text>So Duty's the defender against the Zone, right? I don't see them manning the Barrier, how many of their guys have died fighting against brainwashed maniacs? Well, I have to give credit to Gatekeeper too, he's quite the impressive guy.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_359">
		<text>If you ever are feeling down, go talk to Ashot for awhile. That guy could sleep through an emission, nothing ruins his mood.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_360">
		<text>Pretty typical story. Nature gives us an unimaginable gift of beauty and mystery and the government comes along to put a fence around it and sell it to the highest bidder. Better than those Duty fucks who just want to see it burn.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_361">
		<text>There's no prudes in Freedom, but certain behaviors are not acceptable to the group. For instance, we all like a little hit of something to take the edge off, but don't get violently hooked on meth - you will be shown the door. Most of those sorts join the Bandits, we don't want that kind of person around here.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_362">
		<text>Back in the world I was a backpacker, and an extreme backpacker at that. That's really the reason I came here, to tackle some nature that outdid everything else the world had to offer. I thought Freedom was cool, so I joined up, but I still get to take some long trips deep into the Zone. You should come with me sometime, my man - just bring something for all the mutants.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_363">
		<text>How about this for a story, bro: I was in the Red Forest because a friend of mine who had just quit the Zone left me coordinates for a stash of all his artefact-finding gear. I'm no blockhead, so I'm taking it real slow, observing first and then sneaking along. My PDA led me up to a big tree; I walked around it and found my friend's pack in a huge fissure that ran down the trunk. I was just about to leave when I heard footsteps from the other side of the tree. I thought there were maybe five or six guys and they stopped moving for awhile so I snuck a peak around the side: a fucking squad of Monolith! So I just crouched there, behind the tree with half my body in the fissure. They didn't talk, but they did this weird sort of humming thing. Meanwhile, I'm thinking that it's all over for me; that they would notice me any second. I waited for six hours like that - imagine that! Then they left, and I hurried my lucky ass home.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_364">
		<text>What's up with all these power-hungry asswipes in Freedom now? I suggested that we should pool our resources that we find out in the Zone and then distribute them evenly to all faction-members, but they just brushed me off! I guess this group is really going to the profiteers. Nobody around here even wants to talk about economics.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_365">
		<text>It's a shame that its so hard to go between Yanov station and the Warehouses - make your pick between Radar and Red Forest. Oh man, what a choice! Go ahead and pick between certain death or nearly certain death. Man, I haven't seen my old friends in awhile.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_366">
		<text>If you need an edge against the local fauna as well as little army peons, then drop by Skinflint's place. He can hook you up with some real NATO badassery. Careful when you sell stuff to him, though - he can really pinch pennies</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_367">
		<text>Just take in the Zone, man - the freeest place in the world. No laws, no cops, no chokeholds. Just the law of nature out here, and you better get with its program or else you'll end up wasted. Not me, though. The Zone and I are on the same wavelength.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_368">
		<text>If you need to know something, just hit up Yar in Yanov station. That guy's seen some shit - been here way before you or me. He's seen the Zone from Dark Valley to Pripyat; if he wasn't settled down as a permanent fixer, there's nobody else I'd want to watch my back.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_369">
		<text>Did you know that the scientists only touch the surface with the Zone? Ok, you might not know this, but the Zone is actually like a global hotspot for occult energy. No, I'm not talking Ouija board shit, I mean like a lifeline between the physical reality and the unitive energy of existence. Yeah, most people are too close-minded to hear this out, but its not so far-fetched when you consider how bizarre and alien the Zone is already. Where do you think those Psy-storms are from, all that crazy mind-control stuff that we keep hearing about? There's a hidden power here, a life-force. I'm just trying to get acquainted, that's all.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_370">
		<text>Leshiy is really tempting me with his stories of the kinds of artefacts way up north by Pripyat. If you're going to trust anyone as an expert on anomalies, why not choose a guy who was actually inside of one?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_371">
		<text>I think Zulu was the only Dutyer I've ever liked, he seemed to have some sense in his head. Most Dutyers would rather sit out under an emission than share a room with Freedom. He did good, but it couldn't last forever. And now, we are the rightful owners of Yanov - just as it should be.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_372">
		<text>I think a strict hierarchy stifles a person's creative potential. He not only becomes a demeaning cog in a machine, but also I think he loses his ability too. Calcification leads to low efficiency. Well, that's sort of what Loki's been telling me. He's an insightful man.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_373">
		<text>Where the hell did those lurker things come from? One day everyone just starts talking about them like they've always been here. Just goes to show that the unfriendly regions of the Zone are always cooking up new surprises for you. I'd also like to add that the Warehouses really don't need any more guests, escpecially not those that go in for human flesh.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_374">
		<text>I don't doubt that there are scarier places, but I think that the most unsettling is the Barrier. You're just waiting there, peering over the impaled skulls and burning wrecks, wondering what's coming down this road, wondering if something is about to be in view. One of these days, something really unstoppable will get vomited out of that pass and that will be the end of us.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_375">
		<text>Yo, what the fuck's been happening recently? There was that guy who was mixing some LSD with some sort of anomalous material - that killed a couple guys. Then those Estonians got electrocuted trying to make a pirate radio to piss off Duty. Then there's the Monolith - what's in the water supply these days?</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_information_376">
		<text>Bro, just keep an eye out for new recruits doing anything fishy. Lukash says that Duty's trying to infiltrate us these days. Duty! Can you imagine some stuck-up army pissant trying to pass himself off as Freedom? Anyway, be on the lookout.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_377">
		<text>I know that Lukash remains in close contact with some associates on the outside in order to maintain a safe path through the border. In addition to beefing up Freedom's fighting force, he's also trying to facilitate a way for enthusiasts to get access to a free and open Zone. He has to be careful though, because a few years ago someone snitched and the army toadies came down on us like a ton of bricks.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_378">
		<text>Goddamnit, we really need to be more careful about emission warnings; every time we crawl out of our holes, there's another person who will never answer on the radio again. Usually, we find them later, hunched-over and gibbering their brains out of their heads. It's a miserable way to die.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_379">
		<text>Man, I've had some sort of burning rash for weeks now. I've been sort of avoiding Solid because... well, there aren't any malpractice attorneys in the Zone. Maybe that's a blessing.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_380">
		<text>There was a real psychotic in Freedom who left a couple of months back, did you know him? Well, I can't remember his name, but it was something weird, even for the Zone. This dude thought that he was actually the reincarnation of Vladimir Lenin and he went around talking like it. He wasn't just some excited Marxist kid, this guy had issues. He wanted an economic reform in the Zone, all well and good in Freedom, but... he considered the mutants to be the oppressed class and all stalkers as the exploiters. Yup. Although, I did see him kill a bloodsucker personally and I think he was calling it a "class traitor" while he did it. Yeah, that guy was actually insane. We kinda liked him around here though, he was like the village lunatic. He walked out of base one day and never came back. Freedom is a bit more dull now.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_381">
		<text>Kinda ironic that we, who are always talking about an open Zone, are in charge of manning the Barrier. Hey, I'm not complaining, just think that irony is usually pretty potent in the Zone.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_382">
		<text>Dude, fuck Leshiy, guy's a crypto-Dutyer and a former Merc. Just because he had a bad turn with an anomaly, now he hates the miracles created by the Zone. I mean, what's he even doing in Freedom if he thinks that? Anyway, he was an asshole to some of our guys, told then that they should quit just cause they hit a rough patch. He's more Merc than Freedom - he doesn't give a shit when some of our best stalkers bite the dust; he makes jokes!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_383">
		<text>Just hang in there man, we're the only thing stopping the industrial takeover of the Zone. No one else will do it. When I hold a Moonlight in my hand, after navigating the trials of the Zone's natural defenses, and I look into glowing radiance of its beauty and see the mysteries of nature unraveling before me... I think of what this place would look like if it was turned into a government quarry, extracting such artefacts for the creation of weapons, all to the highest bidder on the global market. Can't let it happen.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_384">
		<text>I don't know if I'm getting paranoid or something, but I can't shake off the feeling of being followed. It doesn't matter where I am: hanging out in Yanov station, guard shift in the Warehouses, out on patrol... There's something there, something in the corner of my eye that never leaves me alone, like a bad omen. Maybe I should leave off the heavy stuff for awhile, but it helps me forget about whatever this is. What do you think? Is some controller messing with my mind? Can't even get a good night's sleep with this shit. If I end up dead in unusual circumstances, then you'll know I was right.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_385">
		<text>I don't get these solid Freedomers who like the Mercs - what the hell? Those guys are worse profiteers than the army shitheads that we fight against; each one of them is totally here to sell off pieces of the Zone to their private employers.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_386">
		<text>Some of us are pretty wary of the soldiers of fortune over in Dead City, but they're alright in my book. Duty and Freedom have been at nearly a stalemate for years; Mercs might help us tip the balance. They're not too friendly, but they can really handle a shooter.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_387">
		<text>Some of those Bandits are bad news, but other guys are more like us: they just want to have a good time and they don't want any puppet-masters pulling their strings. They can hook you up if you're low, too.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_388">
		<text>When are more loners going to realize that they have to fight for the Zone? Otherwise, it's not going to be around. They line their pockets with artefacts and then split. No thank-you, no gratitude.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_389">
		<text>Gotta love the eggheads. They're so caught up with their measurements and their tests that they can't see the Zone for what it is. They only see how the Zone is useful, not how it is valuable in itself. Well, what do expect from government boys?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_390">
		<text>Ay, my man! Hit us up in the Warehouses or Jupiter. We'll have some good times!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_391">
		<text>Hey bro, do you know Hawaiian? He told me to ask Free Stalkers if you knew about some guy named Degtyarev. Yeah, I don't know. Told him I'd do him a solid.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_392">
		<text>What is it that you dudes like in the Truck Cemetery anyway? Good birdwatching there? Only birds I see are nasty crows and the occasional army gunship.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_393">
		<text>Greetings, my scientifical friend! Do you happen to have any medicines on hand? I could use some right about now.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_394">
		<text>Who hey, this guy's trying to kill me! ... Nah, just talking shit. What's with the grimace? You need to loosen up, my friend.</text>
	</string>
	
	<!-- MERCENARIES -->
	<string id="dm_information_395">
		<text>It's just another job. No more, no less. "The Zone this!", "The Zone that!". Who gives a shit? It's just a place, just happens to be more dangerous than most. I'm here to do a job, and I'm going to do what needs to get done.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_396">
		<text>Am I an information kiosk? Why don't you just look around? People just fill you with bullshit anyway, better to see something with your own eyes.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_information_397">
		<text>Efficiency is the key in the Zone. Why do missions fail? Why do stalkers perish in anomaly fields? It's down to efficiency. You have to know what you are supposed to be doing and do it in the most expedient way possible. Once you resolve on what to do, just do it - no second guesses, no hesitating. Don't let some sort of misplaced sense of compassion get in the way; shoot and then continue on.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_information_398">
		<text>We weren't the first outside agency to take interest in the Zone and we aren't the last either; they've all put feelers into the Zone to see if they can get something from it. That friendly, talkative loner that you met around the campfire - he could be running a job for anyone. You wouldn't believe the sorts of foreign strings I've seen in here - Iranian, Chi-Coms, CIA... And some others that I'd best not even mention.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_information_399">
		<text>It's best to plan for every contingency, especially out here. My friendly advice today is: do it. Take a few hours with a map and plan out everything that could happen to you on your way and what you would do about it. Then, memorize that plan so you can draw on it in a moment's notice. This is the only way to be successful here, you need a plan for everything. That's why when the Monolith flood down from the north, our boys will be the only ones that live to tell the tale.</text>
	</string>		
	<string id="dm_information_400">
		<text>If you feel the ground shake, then there's a good chance you're fucked. That's probably a pseudogiant hungry for your tasty meat. There was a light recon squad that was tagged by one so they decided to engage it. They filled it with lead and it kept coming. They expended every magazine they had and it kept coming. How do you think they felt when it caught up to them? Can you beg for mercy from one of those monsters? No. They each died with a knife in hand. Moral of the story: pack some grenade launchers or a good pair of running shoes.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_401">
		<text>People think there's strength in numbers. Maybe. But the Zone is the master of divide and conquer. We observed this army expedition try to push up to Zaton once in order to establish a bridgehead there; we wanted to make sure that our interests were not endangered. These guys had it all: motor transport, heavy weapons, choppers and as much manpower as you could want. Over the miles of irradiated, unmapped and hostile territory they began to disintegrate; the Zone extracted its toll. Manpower just melted away into nothing, the vehicles broke down or became stuck, impassable anomaly fields stalled the operation. When the remains of the expedition limped into Zaton, there was almost nothing left. Then, someone ambushed them and put an end to it. The Zone doesn't care about your numbers.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_information_402">
		<text>I've found that the Zone seems to attract the worst elements of humanity and corrupts them even further. All sorts of nasty people wander in here trying to flee the law, or even the laws of nature. We found a den of some sort of Satanic cult or something like that. They had been kidnapping passing stalkers, torturing them to death and drinking their blood. No joke. We caught wind of it when one of our guys went missing; we ended up finding their little hole in a dirty basement and we just tossed in a couple dozen frags until opposition had ceased. The thing is, we think their might be more of them. We've been hearing similar stories from Red Forest and Yanov.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_403">
		<text>The Dead City's not so dead. Looks like it at first, but there's usually something lurking around in the dark places out of the sunlight. We've been through all of the buildings and passages, but don't go in there alone. Ever since the old residents moved out, there's been a quiet, but steady, stream of new residents moving in. Our facility is just the most recent addition.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_404">
		<text>What's the fucking point of it all anyway? Answer me that. These all-important documents, the "vital" artefacts, the petty low-lifes we need to exterminate... What's it all coming to? This place is a slaughterhouse and some sort of sick lab experiment rolled into one. Grab this, kill that... What do they know about it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_405">
		<text>Yeah, what do you want? Maybe you should stop looking for free handouts and go see things for yourself. Here's a tip: the south is fat and boring, the north is full of death and the army toadies are hemming us in from the other sides, so pick a direction and start walking.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_406">
		<text>There's sort of a no-man's land in Limansk where we can look out across the blasted terrain to the land of the enemy, the Monolith. It's always sort of eerie there, and quiet; well, quiet until things heat up. I can tell you why they're called the Monolith: it's because they act as one being, always. That's the "mono" part. They also will not stop coming until you end their lives, they just don't care - while they have motor function, they will be trying to put a bullet in your brain. That's the "lith" part. They disregard everything - pain, cold, dark, numbers - they will continue on like a faultless machine, unchangeable as a rock.</text> 
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_407">
		<text>The north of the Zone is hungry. Pripyat, the NPP, Radar - they all demand to be fed. They most love the flesh of well-funded military expeditions, but they're not so picky. Loners seeking for wonders untold, bandit subhumans loking to rob them, various factions going about their petty little objectives - all meat for the hungry belly of the Zone. I'm sure you've noticed how few stalkers who take the trip up there never come back. It's up to you, are you desperate enough?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_408">
		<text>The Army Warehouses is a fun getaway spot if you enjoy war-zones. It's also our backyard, so we need to have a border guard to stop riff-raff from getting in; luckily, we're mostly blocked-off by the Bloodsucker Village and most stalkers shit themselves even talking about that place. Sometimes it feels like we're the only adults on the playground.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_409">
		<text>I don't know. Someone seems to have left a door open in one of those underground labs, because freaks are spewing forth into the Zone like never before. I've seen one of those things that they call Burers before when I was out by Jupiter. Evil and dangerous little fuckers, and they've got some tricks up their sleeves as well, so don't take them lightly. They use your own strength against you, and when you're all busted up with your equipment broken - well, that's when they close in to tear your throat out with their teeth.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_410">
		<text>One time we got job, contracted from some of the eggheads in Yantar, real simple: just go into the Agroprom underground and nab some documents from a safe. Nothing to it really: the tunnels were quiet, we had our asses covered in every respect, the safe was even busted open for us. We left this Belorussian named Voron in the outer room while we went to the inner room where the documents were. In five minutes, we had found what we needed and returned to find Voron gone; no trace, no clue, no nothing. He was ten feet away from us on the other side of a wall, and we didn't hear or see a thing. He just vanished - or, in my opinion, got taken. When the Zone is quiet, you should be getting nervous.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_411">
		<text>There's nowhere I hate more than the long quiet road from Dead City to Yantar. I think I'd rather take a stroll through Radar. When you get a kilometer or so south of the city, you realize that you can't hear any sounds but your own shuffling feet. It's always dark there, even the sun shining in the clear sky isn't enough to shed light on that grey desolation. That's not to mention every alarm bell going off in your head that something big is watching you the whole time. Then you have to pass through the plant with the Miracle Machine, which is a really bad idea even if that abomination happens to be shut off. I'm going around from now on.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_412">
		<text>Don't get too friendly with any of the outsiders; you never know when they'll be your next assignment.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_413">
		<text>It used to be different. Back in the day, we were employed by various outside benefactors for the completion of a small task - usually someone looking for some special artefacts, a set of research documents, or maybe a couple freaks for someone's personal collection. We used to be insertion teams: get in, set up an outpost and get the job done, be out as soon as possible. Now that's all changed. The private teams got pushed out of the Zone or killed when Dushman decided to form all mercenaries in the Zone under a strict hierarchy with a permanent base. Question has always been - is that all? Is there some very powerful employer on the outside looking for something special? Do we work for Dushman or someone else? I've said enough.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_414">
		<text>You've got to have a release, otherwise you'll lose your mind. Most guys go for drinking, and I think it's probably a good idea. Otherwise, you'll start looking for people to waste for no reason. Our jolly bartender Aslan, for example; when he first got here, he got a reputation for being a real maniac. You didn't fucking cross him or you'd end up in a ditch or who knows where else. As you can tell, he's mellowed out since then, though he's still extremely secretive. But you have to wonder how he gets off nowadays; maybe that's a question best left unanswered.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_415">
		<text>Leopard has been in Dead City way before we made it our headquarters, it's been his home ever since he entered the Zone years ago. He mostly stayed in Dead City, rooting around in the tunnels and basements for something, he's never said what. Like us, he chose to make the sports center his hideout; for some reason, it's one of the few places in Dead City that is reltively benign. Can you imagine him, all alone, looking out over the city square in the morning, peacefully smoking a cigarette?</text>

	<string id="dm_information_416">
		<text>I knew this one old guy who left the Zone years ago, but he was probably the toughest stalker I've ever met. He used to be a Sealous Scout, he knew how to live off the land in the world's shittiest places and he came here when he heard that we had the shittiest place of all. That crazy bastard lived by himself in the wilderness, harvesting mutant meat and charting paths through anomalies and radiation. That guy didn't give a shit about artefacts or idealism, he just wanted a challenge.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_417">
		<text>I can tell you there are about six thousand ways to find your death out here, and that new ones are being invented all the time. A few nights ago, some of our operatives were woken up by something that sounded like a whistle coming out of the sky. And as the night went on, it got progressively louder until they were stuffing their ears, trying to keep out the pain. By sunrise, it had dissapated into nothing, but that's not the end of the story. Three out of the four of those men have since died, apparently some sort of brain aneurysm. They followed all the rules and there they are: lost to the Zone.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_418">
		<text>This operation isn't like any other, this isn't Mosul or Grozny or Sierra Leone. There are no civvies here, no friendly territory, no backup. Whenever you walk into a new place, you can bet that the native population wants you dead, along with the wildlife and even the goddamn laws of nature. The Zone doesn't want us here, nothing wants us here. So wake the fuck up.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_419">
		<text>I've been saying for years that we need to adapt our armament to this environment. Fancy rifles, LMGs and automatic shotguns are good as far as it goes, but how's that going to work out when the Chimera ruins your day? This is the Zone: there's no Geneva Conventions, no Hague, so what's the problem here? How about a Great War revival? Flamethrowers and poison gas in each expedition. That should keep the freaks at bay. Where's the white phosphorous? Let's not play nice against the Zone.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_420">
		<text>Military training helps with keeping cool and staying alert, but it's just not enough for the Zone. Plenty of tough-guy Spetsnaz have bit the dust when they underestimated the Zone. On the other hand, many of the legendary stalkers are just nobodies: fishermen, electricians, petty criminals... Some people say it's experience, other's say that it's an instinct tht you have to get born with. The only thing I know: all the rules are different around here.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_421">
		<text>Damn, those French bastards can sing when they get drunk. How about some fucking sleep already? And their Russian is shit, maybe they could spend more than a few days learning the language. Ah, hell. As long as they're on top of things out in the wild, they can talk in Chinese for all I care. What were you saying?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_422">
		<text>The system is better now. When contractors sent their own teams into the Zone they were disorganized and had little protection from being screwed over, either by the employers themselves or the other residents of the Zone. Now, any jobs done in the Zone have to go through Dushman, who negotiates a better price as well as providing more security for operatives inside the Zone. There are some times when outside organizations try to get around this, though. Last year, Aslan caught a small team of Israelis trying to leave the Zone with some regenerative artefacts; we discovered correspondence in one of their PDAs to a pharmaceutical conglomerate that was funding them. We sent them a message, a very definitive one. If they want a job done in here, you can pay us or you can go to hell.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_423">
		<text>When comms went down, we thought Griffin's team had been wiped out. We heard something about spotting Spetsnaz forces and then silence; naturally, we assumed they were dead. Months later, one of our teams ends up in the Outskirts while tracking a wounded pseudogiant and, lo and behold, Griffin's team is alive and well in the bookstore. They explained their situation, but Dushman is still pissed. They don't want to come back empty-handed because they know Dushman will rake them over the coals. So we have sort of a standoff, where the outpost in the Outskirts is under its own command but still loyal to Dushman. It can't go on forever, something's got to snap.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_424">
		<text>Sometimes, it's worth contracting some stalkers as guides to the more tricky places. Just remember, you might need to clean them up afterwards if they see something compromising.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_425">
		<text>We have to retain a secure base of operations in order to launch missions elsewhere. That's why Dushman gets so paranoid of anyone getting close to Dead City without his approval. That's why those Bandit shits who were caught spying got their index fingers cut off. And some others... have not been heard from again.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_426">
		<text>How are you going to spend your payment? I can't even visualize the outside world anymore. Dachas, girls, boozing... they don't appeal to me like they used to. It feels like this is reality now: the Zone. I don't think I'll ever be leaving.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_427">
		<text>The Zone is the biggest opportunity of recent memory. No, I'm not going to drone on about artefacts or discoveries or any of that shit. I mean that this can turn out to be the beginnings of a new state, ruled by competent men who know how to get things done. I've seen several insurrections go down the drain, but the Zone is different. There's just enough lawlessness and anarchy here to start from scratch. The good thing is that this place weeds out all of the weak and useless, so we don't have to bother with them. All we really have to deal with are the petty little factions here already, but don't think we couldn't take care of them. It's really the Monolith we have to worry about - they're the ones who can really call the shots.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_428">
		<text>I see faces when they aren't there. Yeah, I know it's cliche, but that's how it happens. You're watching the target through your 12x magnification optic and you can see every expression on his face, every blink. Then, you squeeze the trigger and you see how the face dies, you can read what's going on behind the eyes. Even when they're wearing masks... they have "faces" still - those also imprinted in your brain. They become faces in your dreams, their glass eyes and rubber mouths twist themselves into expressions of pain and confusion. Oh, what the hell, just fuck off.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_429">
		<text>Surgeon's given up the way of the gun but, to me, he's worth ten knuckle-dragging grunts. That guy can nearly resurrect the dead. One time he saved this guy who had a meter-long section of rebar sticking out from his ribcage - a poltergeist had deposited it in his right lung. After three hours of solo surgery, the Merc was stable. The guy's a miracle-worker! Funny thing is, nobody knows anything about him; there were some rumors that he used to be stationed up near Jupiter, but no-one knows for sure.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_430">
		<text>Ok, a classic story, but well worth repeating. And it might not even be bullshit. Some Mercs were out somewhere south of the plant at sunset and had just gotten around a huge gravitational field. They find some sort of factory garage and decide to take cover for the night. They heave the big rusty doors open and the building is dark, really dark. A flashlight is turned on and they are immediately looking into the face of a Chimera - it was just waiting there. The guy with the light doesn't even have a chance to turn, he gets pounced and shredded as his buddies fire in panic before running off in different directions. Soon, there's only one guy left and he hides behind an old gas tank. He waits, and he waits and he hears the thing approaching and he knows that he has no chance. The mutant turns the corner.. sees him... and out of blue fucking nowhere a BTR comes crashing by and slams into the Chimera. Then it drives off into the setting sun. What, you don't believe that?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_431">
		<text>Vector is the guy in the waste-processing station who's in charge of vending supplies to our teams in the area. He's also a total asshole. Don't lend him anything if you ever want it back. And don't trust a single word he says about anomaly paths - I'm convinced he's actually trying to get someone killed. Kolin's a much better source of info on everything.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_432">
		<text>Boars are no joke, and I've got a pretty scar down my whole leg if you want proof of that. You see them in the rural areas away from the factories and towns, usually just grazing in the distance, and you take no notice of them. Then, suddenly, they're right on top of you with no warning - 600 pounds of pissed-off mutant horns and hooves. Leading them into explosive traps is usually good, but you can snipe them from a distance if you've got an escape plan.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_433">
		<text>It's all shit. That's what. I used to be flying choppers in Syria. Now I'm humping a ruck over kilometers of irradiated hellscape keeping an eye out for escaped mental patients armed with experimental railguns. Or maybe pissed-off genetic abortions with telekinesis. I can't wait to get out of here.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_434">
		<text>Aslan used to run me and some other operatives as a sort of infiltration unit, slipping into other factions for awhile, then we would be reported "MIA", lost to the Zone. Yeah, we like to keep tabs on all the other players in the Zone, we know much more about them than they suspect.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_435">
		<text>There's nothing more pathetic than the so-called "Free Stalkers" - no training, no organization, no plan... They're almost always easy targets, but usually the rest of the Zone gets to them before we do.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_436">
		<text>Bandits are complete scum who couldn't find their own ass with a map, but they can be helpful in the course of our operations. We also do business with them sometimes, usually selling gear and munitions in return for artefacts looted from loners.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_437">
		<text>Hog used to be buddies with some of the Freedomers over in the Warehouses, and we still cut deals with them sometimes. As for myself, I think those dumbass junkies don't deserve to live. Oh, how I wouldn't enjoy shutting up some of those dickheads permanently.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_438">
		<text>We've had a long and complex history dealing with those eggheads. Sometimes we protected them when the army got washed out, sometimes they sent us on unauthorized fetch quests into the Zone, sometimes they got a new big brother to watch their useless asses for them. You might also know what happened to Black's team, but that's ancient history. I think we had organized a truce recently, but who knows anymore?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_439">
		<text>Those army boys are so hopeless - their command structure is shot through with stupidity and greedy arrogance. Maybe if we were hired to keep stalkers out of the Zone, things would have turned out differently. To be fair, some of the military guys are good operators and I think a couple have even come over to our side.</text>
	</string>

	<!-- BANDITS -->
	<string id="dm_information_440">
		<text>All you gotta do is follow the rules of common-sense: why risk your ass going into anomalies when you can just lift the artefacts off of some dupe? Why wait for that loner dickhead to shoot you instead of just wasting him before he gets the chance? Why get eaten by a pack of dogs when you can just kneecap your buddy and get away? Don't give me any of that nice guy shit, this is the real world. As real as it comes.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_441">
		<text>You ever see those skinhead freaks that mess with your mind? Some people call them Controllers. I call them bitches. Just gotta put some lead in their brain-box and then they're not so tough. That a problem for you, pussy? I've killed dozens, just ask any of the real fighters around here.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_442">
		<text>I was a highly-desirable man out in the world. That's right, I had the local cops, the ministry of the interior, even the goddamn Interpol pussyfooting around me. I'd like to see them find me now. Could you imagine some day-shift pig or stuck-up spook trying to get in here?</text> 
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_443">
		<text>My old man was in the camps when he was young, he was one of the ones that made a name for himself, didn't take shit from anyone and got what he wanted from others. You know they had handles back then too? He was called "The Wrist" after he back-handed some chumps. He always beat the shit out of me, but I thank him now - he taught me everything I'd need to know.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_444">
		<text>I mean, the whole Zone's calling out for order, right? Who's going to give it to them? Loner's aren't interested, the Military are a joke, Duty? Don't make me laugh. The only ones who can give a structure to this loony bin are us and those Monolith maniacs. And I don't think you'd want to see the kind of order they'd make.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_445">
		<text>Hey, got some weird shit for ya. I was south of our Truck Cemetery outpost one night taking a smoke break, no-one else around. Then I heard the sound of an engine, no joke, somewhere out south. I thought: "All of these trucks are rusted to shit for fifty years", but there it was. It was moving too, sounded just like someone was driving it. Well, I guess if someone wanted to hide their working vehicle, the Cemetery is the best place for it. Or it's just the Zone fucking with our heads again.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_446">
		<text>Hey, I if were you, I'd load up on something before you pull off an ambush. Some vodka really takes the edge off, but there's nothing better than a line of coke to really get pumped-up. Making decisions is way easier and you won't mind getting some injuries.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_447">
		<text>You never know what you're going to find on some stalker. I once had a guy who had nothing in his pack but fancy wristwatches - hundreds! We had a good time with his stuff, I think I'm still hung-over from that.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_448">
		<text>Yeah, I don't give out shit for free. If you're looking for a tip, just stay the hell out of my way. I don't give two shits who you are, I'll put you down like one of those blind dogs.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_449">
		<text>Ever hear of Yaro Nose? He was one of us who went soft, started ratting to the army bitches. When Sultan found out, he prepared something special for him. He had him tied up, legs and arms, into a sad little crying bundle and then... then, he dropped him into a dark basement and closed up the trap-door. But the basement wasn't empty. Next day, we opened it up and Yaro looked a bit different; a dozen starving Tushkanos saw to that. We hung out his body for awhile to explain to punks what happens when you turn snitch.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_450">
		<text>Sultan's been up and Sultan's been down, but no-one can ever quite put him under. They used to say that he was going to be running the Zone one day - maybe, maybe not. But no other boss has ever risen since he took up his place in Dark Valley... well, there was one or two. But those got knocked out real quick; no-one remembers the name of Shishak these days.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_451">
		<text>Hah, we've pulled some stunts my man. Here's one you can use too. Just check by some of those places where chumps try to get some artefacts until you come across the corpse of some loner who got a little too close to the Electro and got zapped. Then you take his PDA and tell his friends that you had taken him hostage and wanted all the cash and swag they could come up with. Then, arrange the meet in your favor and point them the direction to their old buddy, enjoy! Well, and maybe leave a note on him explaining how he died. We wouldn't want to piss off those stalkers, right?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_452">
		<text>Those fuckin' freaks are everywhere, that's what's goin on. Hey, never get cheap with bullets if you want to live through a mutant encounter. You fill 'em with some hot lead and think they're done for, then they jump when you've turned around and try to pay you back the favor. Douple tap to the brain even after they've stopped moving, only way to be sure. Fuckin' Zone.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_453">
		<text>Ever see one of those moving fireball things? Yeah, don't get too comfortable. Right when you think you've got their pattern figured out, they can swing by and ruin your day. Buddy of mine said that they're attracted to radio signals and artefacts. I don't really know, but don't be a dipshit.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_454">
		<text>Yeah, do your best to not get sent on one of those patrols. You go out and there's a good chance you never come back. Sometimes you're totally gone and no-one ever finds your body, but usually we see corpse eaten away by dogs or riddled with bullets if they ran into the Duty patrol. The good life out here is sitting around the campfire getting wasted on imported vodka. Hero-shit is past retarded.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_455">
		<text>Everyone around here pisses his pants when the Monolith get brought up, who knew there were so many little bitches in the Bandits? Yeah, I don't give a shit about the fuckin' Monolith. When I was put away outside, nobody messed with me. If they messed with me, they knew that they'd get a cut throat one night. I didn't get here by being a little bitch. I'd like to see those white-clothed little asswipes try anything with me.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_456">
		<text>Nothing like a Darkscape vacation: you get to see all the beauty and flourishing that Chernobyl has to offer! A scenic hike through an enchanting forest, complete with a natural camping experience at night! And if the irradiated boars don't rip you apart, the army patrol will put a bullet in your ass!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_457">
		<text>The Cordon is the best place in the world, change my mind! You get to sit around with your pals and smoke while cute little loner rookies pass by day and night. You just have to show up behind them with a shooter in your hand and they'll give up all their brand-new gear they brought in from outside the Zone - way too easy! Gotta keep a watch out for those army boys, though.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_458">
		<text>Some morons think that they're going to get rich if they go into some of the abandoned buildings around here or, even worse, the underground labs. Hey, listen up - there's nothing in there but a bunch of busted science toys and a shitload of angry freaks. You don't wanna go in there.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_459">
		<text>Ever been in Yanov before? It's pretty tight down at the Container Warehouse, especially since Duty got their asses kicked out of the station. Now, though, you gotta watch out for those crazy lunatics from Pripyat. And the thing about them is that you can't buy them out or intimidate them. Nope, they're real bad news.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_460">
		<text>Man, I don't like this gunfighting wild west shit that's goin' on around here. We used to be able to frisk some rookies and then send them on their way, but now it's just shoot on sight. Can't even make a decent score without risking a gunshot.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_461">
		<text>I laugh at all this shit. What kind of blockhead retards actually come to the Zone looking for riches and "discoveries"? All of these morons are all here thinking that they'll become rich and famous, when they're really headed straight into the belly of the nearest mutant. It's hysterical. As for me, I'm here to watch. And to pick up the stuff they leave behind.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_462">
		<text>We used to run the Garbage, man; had a good thing going. But Yoga was weak and look where he got us. Stalkers from the south and those Duty assholes in the north, not to mention the army shits wandering around. That train station's nearly empty now, used to be a good place to rest up and get something to eat.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_463">
		<text>Most pricks who wear the skull patch are loudmouth little thugs who would shit themselves if they saw any real action. I've done some things on the outside. I used to run hits, and not just fat drug-dealers - no, I've whacked out government officials and inmates in a federal prison. Screw the Mercs, they didn't want to pay for my skills, so too bad for them. Now I'm here, watching over a bunch of slack-jawed low-lifes, used to nothing more than snatching the purses of helpless old women.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_464">
		<text>The Zone's got a way of turning the tables on you - you do something a thousand times and on the thousand and first, you get screwed. We held up this single loner in the woods around Darkscape - nothing special, just a guy with a grimy sunrise suit and mask. Except that he didn't have a shooter and he never said a word. We just put a pistol in his face and he raises his hands up in a kinda jerky way. We dig through his pack to find all his shit is junk: rotting food, old busted electronics and whatnot. So we march him away, thinking we could ransom him, and it feels like the Zone is actively trying to resist us. We keep tripping over shit and getting stuck, we can't find the way out and we have to fight off a bunch of the local wildlife, really agressive. At this point, we're spooked, so we just tell the guy to get lost and he walks away without a word. When we get back out to the road, we find his suit and his gear just laying on a tree stump - no guy in it! I don't know what that stalker was, but you have to know when to let go.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_465">
		<text>Those pseudodogs freaks are fuckin' nuts man, they're like psychopaths dressed up as dogs. They're not just animals, I know that; animals don't enjoy cruelty but those monsters do. I've seen it before, they cripple a guy, rip up his limbs and then just play around with him. Sometimes it's hours before the guy dies. You can see it in their faces, they're way more like people than dogs. It's totally fucked.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_466">
		<text>I hate Psy storms, man. Just when you think the Zone is bad enough with its emissions, it surprises you again with yet another trick that can fry your brain. I get headaches too, but I sorta get them right before the storm hits, so I have my own little warning system. Be nice, and I'll let you in on it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_467">
		<text>You know, some guys who join up with the Bandits aren't so bad. Some guys are pushed into the Zone and they feel a bit lost, they see all the shit in here and join up for a sense of security, of brotherhood. If we don't organize, the Zone will chew us up and spit us out.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_468">
		<text>Used to know this guy named Brand, that guy was the real deal. If you gave him shit, you would always end up underground. One time he baited an army squad into a meeting and then had them ambushed and wasted - those assholes thought they found another informer. He also ran as an info broker, he would trade weapon cache coordinates for tips. One day, though, he was caught skimming some stuff off of Olivius' arms shipment. As scary as you were, you don't just screw-over Olivius. That was the last we heard of Brand, but someone said that they tied him up outside right before an emission. If you see a pissed-off zombie walking around with three fingers on his left hand, that's him.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_469">
		<text>The Swamps are fucked, man. You know how many people go in and don't come out? Not to mention the war that's been going on for years and years. It's like a knife-fight in a sewer.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_470">
		<text>Olivius used to be the top dog in the Dark Valley, but when Sultan showed up, his ass kicked out of Zaton, it looked like there was going to be a fight. Luckily, Limpid stepped in and worked out a deal. But, to tell you the truth, it's pretty obvious to everyone that Sultan does pretty much whatever he wants now. Olivius is none too happy.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_471">
		<text>What, you think I owe you something because we wear the same patch? You think we're buddies? I'd trade your ass in a second for an escape route. When the bullets start flying, every man for himself so don't expect any free handouts.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_472">
		<text>For fuck's sake, don't go around telling outsiders the details of our operation here. Dumbass rookies with with shit for brains go around blabbing to anybody about our ambush spots or our trade deals, and we wonder why we get screwed over so often.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_473">
		<text>When you set up an ambush, don't be a sucker and put yourself at a disadvantage. Here's what you do: just set up a little tripmine in the path, not enough to scatter someone to the four winds, but just enough to blow their legs out and disable any of the guy's friends. Now it's a whole lot easier to bargain, eh? Or do what I do, just give a couple bullets a piece and then you can shop their pockets at your own leisure.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_474">
		<text>Man, I can't wait until we're in charge of the whole Zone - things will be so much easier. It'll be better for everyone, really: "Sure, we'll let you into the Zone, but you gotta give us half of what you make". Let us see some cash and we'll make sure you get some protection. Simple. Better than the mess we're in right now.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_475">

	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_476">
		<text>Dangle an artefact in front of clueless loners and you can trick them into anything. Why do they even come here? I think they'd be better off working as wage-slaves somewhere.</text>

		<text>Mercs think they're badasses because their daddy bought them fancy weapons and equipment. Try bringing down a charging boar with just a knife, then you can talk about being some sort of elite killer.</text>

	<string id="dm_information_478">
		<text>I'm surprised that we don't own the army toadies already, we bribe them so often that we can do whatever we want in here. When are they going to learn to stop trying to take us down? We're the only ones that can give them their order in the Zone.</text>

	<string id="dm_information_485">
		<text>Used to be in Freedom. Thought that they were lax enough to allow whatever you want - what a load of shit. They got all pissy when I had some fun with one of the ransom captives, especially this stoner shithead. That night I had some fun with him too, which he didn't like too much. They threatened to kill me and kicked me out. Well fuck 'em.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_486">
		<text>I was in the Bandits until I realized it was for pussies. Some punk with an attitude kept ordering me around, even though that's what I came here to get away from. So, fine for him, I slit his throat one night and a couple of his buddies too. One guy was tough, he was really going at me, blood gushing out of his throat and all. I took off from that dump and set out on my own. Story time's over, ok?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_487">
		<text>I will not serve. What's the common denominator between all of these little piss-poor little gangs in here? They all require subservience to some other prick. Nobody's my master, I don't bow to jack shit. This is the way it's supposed to be: me and my shooter and whatever I fuckin' want to do.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_488">
		<text>Some people shit on the swamps. I love it. It's the real world, you better watch your ass or you're getting taken into the reeds and killed. There's no ecstasy like waiting for one of those blue-clad little punks to pass by, and then to spring out and blow out some knee-caps. Then the real fun begins.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_489">
		<text>Haha haha, they can't find me in here. Yeah, feds wanted me for some real heavy work on the outside... they never stopped looking... let them try it. Come into my turf and see what happens. This is my ground now. Nobody puts me down on my ground.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_information_490">
		<text>I had to get out of there, man. Fat-ass Sidorovich his goons, they were all looking at me. Never stopped looking, couldn't sleep. They were just waiting, waiting for me to let my guard down. Screw them, I'm not going to be their lab-rat. I'll take my chances.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_information_491">
		<text>Was over near the pump station the other day... looked into the water. I saw... eyes, first there were just a few, then the whole water was eyes. There's something in the water, ok? Something deep and dark, makes guys go missing. Stay out of that shit.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_information_492">
		<text>There's nothing as beautiful as a well-placed explosive going off right under some army piggy's nose. The column of fire goes up into the sky... it's like sunset. Then there comes the quiet. Sometimes, I like the quiet best of all. One less shitheel in the Zone.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_information_493">
		<text>I used to think we were the hardest dudes in the Zone. But there's this one bloodsucker... he's not like the others. He doesn't just leave corpses drained, no, he carves them up into patterns. Like he's writing in some other language: "He's in Hell, and you're next." I wouldn't sleep if I were you, just stay awake.</text>

		<text>One day, the name of Monolith won't make people shake and cower anymore. One day, it'll be us. We'll be the ones people worry about, we'll be the ones that swoop down and take your lives.

	<!-- LONERS -->
	<string id="dm_information_495">
		<text>The Zone is not what I expected. When I decided to enter the Zone, I imagined I'd be finding artefacts every day, fighting off bandits, forging new paths... There's much more meditation, drudgery, petty dealing and trying to make a living. It's a bit like life on the outside, but less forgiving. Who knows, maybe tomorrow will change that.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_496">
		<text>I've listened to the scientists and other experienced stalkers and they all have different ideas about what will happen with the Zone, what comes next. Here's one that no-one's though of yet: what if the Zone decides to quietly disappear? One day the artefacts stop, all the mutants die out, the Monolith fall apart and then the anomalies fade out of existence... I don't consider it wishful thinking, because the Zone is fundamentally unexpected in character. What could be more unexpected than that?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_497">
		<text>There's more mysterious things in the Zone than people realize, stuff that can't be put into neat little scientific categories. Sometimes you're on the move somewhere, some quiet deserted place out in the Zone, and you see somewhere you want to go - some doorway or a path between some hills. And then you stop. And you can't do it. There's nothing there, nothing to stop you but a completely overwhelming power that flattens your will. You couldn't take that way even if you were running away from death, not possible. I'm not the only one who's experienced this, either.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_498">
		<text>I saw quite the rarity the other day. I was glassing the path in front of me with my scope and I saw what was obviously a zombie staggering around, except this guy was wearing some goofy outfit I've never seen the likes of before. I creep up to him and, sure enough, he's wearing a very old looking environmental suit and it has "ISG" printed on the back! What an antique! Almost felt bad putting it down.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_499">
		<text>Ok, weird question, but is there some guy with a little kid here? Have you seen something like that? I saw some stalker at dusk walking down the road and I swear he was leading a little kid by the hand. What in the hell? I'd bet it's no good, whatever it is. The Zone tries to trick you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_500">
		<text>The first generation of great stalkers is dead and gone, although I hear things about Strelok sometimes. It's always the same story with these new kids: more shiny gear and less common sense. You know, Guide managed to reach the center of the Zone with nothing but his own skill. Not the sort of thing you see these days.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_501">
		<text>Ah, it's so easy to plan out your trips in you head, where you're going to go and what you're going to find there. But when you get out there, then the Zone's in charge so you'd best be ready to dance to its tune. Maybe your way is blocked by a huge herd of flesh, or maybe the door you're counting on it completely blocked-up now. The worst thing that happened to me was some sort of heat anomaly that materialized right above my head! There I was, face-down in the dirt with my back peeling off. I managed to roll off the hill and drag myself to a passing group. That was a close call.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_502">
		<text>You might think that you've seen all the Zone has to offer, but you haven't seen anything until you find the deepest darkest holes that some sort of inhuman abomination can slither into. I had an experience once. Way deep in the Zone, I was passing by this manhole cover when I think I hear a voice, so I see if maybe someone's trapped down there. I push aside the cover and look into total blackness and I hear this voice, and it's trying to get me to come down. At first it pretends it needs help, but then it starts promising me riches. At this point, I'm convinced it's not even human, it doesn't talk like people talk. I have a half-insane urge to just do what is says, but I rip myself away instead and run the hell out of there. I should have dropped a frag down there, but I couldn't think about anything else but leaving.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_503">
		<text>Still waiting on my pile of riches and the attractive women gathered around my feet, in awe of the brave and noble stalker. What a load of shit they talk on the outside, I can't believe I bought into this.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_504">
		<text>I never wanted to kill anyone. I didn't think it would be like that here. I was ready for an adventure and maybe some quick cash on the side, not all this. You know, they don't really mention this kind of thing out in the world.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_505">
		<text>Well, something that I've been considering for a while, just hear me out. I think the noosphere is the real cause of the Zone and I also think that exposure to the noosphere is what causes those bizarre psy effects on living creatures. For instance, get a little dose of the noosphere and you get turned into a crazy Monolith, a little more and you get zombified, applied in a different way, you receive a new sense, an awareness to the noosphere like a Controller. Ok, have you ever heard of the Strangers? It's sort of an urban legend, but apparently before the second emission, there were rumors of people spotted in the Zone that could change into other forms at will. Most people just thought this was an illusion, like the ones you could see around the Miracle Machine, but I don't think so. What if they were stalkers or test subjects who, somehow, received a perfect integration with the noosphere? Where they could shift between the worlds on a whim and change reality? I wonder what happened to them.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_506">
		<text>I came here with my friends, we had all grown up in the same village and we always did everything together. Instead of going off to university or one of the cities, we decided to come here. We wanted an adventure, we imagined a land of opportunity where no-one could hold us back... They're all dead now. Matvei died last week, snork took his guts out. So here I am, living on for all my friends.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_507">
		<text>Spend a couple days listening to your RF radio and you can hear that the Zone is alive with life: expedition reports, aid requests, shit-talking... and some weird things I can't quite understand. I think I catch Monolith signals sometimes, some sort of chanting and humming.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_508">
		<text>Might surprise you, but I've been here for a long time, longer than most. I was a bright-eyed little rookie when I got grabbed by Bandit scumbags and sold as a slave - yes such things used to happen in the Zone. They put me to work digging for artefacts, which they seemed to think would be buried like a treasure chest. That was nearly the end for me, I was starving and infused with radiation, but suddenly we got freed by another squad of loners. I'll always carry those scars, I'll never forget what happened.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_509">
		<text>A buddy of mine said he saw a death truck south of the Jupiter plant one night. Bad news! I haven't heard of those things for ages, but stalkers used to go quiet around the campfire if your brought it up. Always the same questions: Who drives them? Where are they going? What are they up to? Or, maybe my friend just had a couple too many Putinkas.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_510">
		<text>You never want to be out in the wild when night falls, not unless you really know what you're doing. Be smart and plan to be inside a secure location, preferably a friendly camp. I can't imagine trying to fall asleep somewhere out in the Zone, knowing that some monster is just waiting for you to nod off so he can eat. No way.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_511">
		<text>The only thing I really have to talk about is my former companion, a stalker named Dobrina Arrow - you may have heard of him. He was an total madman, went off alone for days at a time hunting dangerous mutants, he found artefacts in anomaly fields with nothing more than a few pebbles... he wasn't afraid of anything, he had a special luck about him. Anyway, one day he gets this idea to go into the Jupiter plant, he said he heard about some sort of magic sphere that would make him the richest man in the Zone. I certainly couldn't tell him no. He insisted on going in alone and he left me at the gates of the complex, bragging that he'd be out soon with his fortune. That was the last I ever saw of him. Well, however he went out, he did it with a fight.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_512">
		<text>Being in the Zone is like sitting on top of an active volcano. We have no idea what it's going to do next or when. Hell, the ecologists can't even predict Emissions with regularity. Suddenly, one fine morning in the Zone, a badass blowout could just come along and wipe the entire population out, all of it. Didn't something like that happen before? What I'm trying to say is that you should treat each day like your last.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_513">
		<text>If I hear one more moronic rookie drone on about what he's going to wish for when he gets to the Wish Granter, I'm going to snap. Do these kids, who haven't even learned to shave, really think they're getting to the power plant? They're in for a rude fucking awakening when they realize that there is no "Wish Granter" and that the Zone holds only misery and painful death. I'd be surprised if they made it to the Garbage without tripping into a Springboard.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_514">
		<text>Unfortunately, the Zone has become a major attraction for some people with serious mental disabilities. They hear all of the bullshit spouted off about the Zone and get here, usually save up their money to pay the smuggler at the border and then they're left without a chance. Sometimes loners or bandits will take them in as eccentrics, but too often they get chewed up by whatever danger happens to pass them by. It's really sad, actually.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_515">
		<text>Here's something real interesting to think about, got it from one of the old-timers: anomaly clusters pretty much control where stalkers can go and what areas they can reach. You may have heard that ten years ago, the Bar was cut off from the rest of the Zone by a wall of anomaly fields. Well, that's not the only time that's happened. My source said that this is the reason why most of the Zone is inaccessible, except for a few expert guides who know the secret paths. Imagine that! Tomorrow, a whole new Zone could open up... or shut down. Just imagine if we could access Chernobyl from the north, we could bypass all the danger and get to the real treasures.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_516">
		<text>Unaffiliated stalkers in the Zone come in all types. When I first entered the Zone, I was in need of a detector and that bastard Sidorovich wanted me to jump through hoops to get one. So fine, I start asking around and come across an experienced loner, seems friendly enough, who knows someone who has a spare one and is willing to let go of it cheaply. He tells me to meet the guy in some little glen in the Garbage and bring the money I have and I agree. I almost get to the spot when I get a nasty feeling of danger and, luckily, decide to trust my instinct - I hide behind some junk a stone's throw away. Good thing. After an hour, four heavily-armed stalkers walk out of the glen and I had no doubt they were waiting to kill me. I'm not sure what saved me that day, but don't trust everyone you meet.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_517">
		<text>One time I ended up lost in the Zone, very lost. I had formed a group with a couple of other inexperienced stalkers and we decided to strike out on our own. Instead of following the accustomed paths, we deliberately chose the more deserted and foreboding ways - although we did so very carefully. Five days after setting out from the Bar, we had completely lost our way and our sense of direction. Our PDAs were glitching out and we may have passed through some sort of space anomaly. Anyway, I saw things that I have never heard any stalker speak of before: a dockyard with a partially-completed tanker ship, a forest island in the middle of a black lake and miles upon miles of storage warehouses besides other things. One day, we realized that we had turned up, somehow, in Zaton. All but one of us, who wandered into an anomaly, made it back. We weren't any richer, but we were thankful enough to be alive.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_518">
		<text>As if there wasn't enough crazies in the Zone, I met these German stalkers who are convinced that the Zone is a product of alien visitation. Isn't this place bizarre enough? Do we really have to bring that X-Files shit in here?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_519">
		<text>We get so caught up in this place, we don't realize what we're missing. I was way out in a lonely corner of the Zone, hunting down a stash, when I came up to this old rotting barn and I discovered some sort of tunnel in the basement. I followed it for quite a long distance and it ended with a trapdoor that opened up into a grassy field. I looked around and noticed how different it felt - the wind, the birds chirping and the sense of calm. That's when I realized... I had exited the Zone! The tunnel must have led right under the fence. I just sat there in the grass, breathing in the fresh air, happiest I've been in a long time. Then I heard a vehicle coming and ducked back into the tunnel. That's when I decided: as soon as I can, I'm getting out of here!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_520">
		<text>Just waiting for the day when my death finds me out here. I've seen all my friends and comrades die around me, I just know that my time is coming up soon. I've done all I've wanted to do in the Zone, seen more than I've wanted to see... I'm not afraid, I'm just positive that I will be dead soon. You can always keep an eye out for death, but it always has a way of getting you when you least expect.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_521">
		<text>You want my story? Well, here's the short version - my brother came into the Zone and died after six months. He managed to get a message to me that he had accumulated a huge stash of valuable artefacts and that he wanted me to get them if I could. Well, I never liked the idea of coming into the Zone, but things aren't so great at home, so I decided to go for it. That was two years ago. Still looking. No, I don't mind telling you - I don't think I'll ever find it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_522">
		<text>Some stalker in Yanov was telling me about this artefact hunter who had found some special artefact that had taken away his hearing when he first touched it. Guy's completely deaf! Apparently the eggheads payed a fortune for it, but it sounds like a raw deal to me.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_523">
		<text>It seems like most stalkers are wearing body-armor these days or, if they can't afford it, sewing metal plates into their coats. Was the Zone alwys so much of a battlefield?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_524">
		<text>I'd swear that it didn't always storm this often. Isn't this place bad enough without always getting your ass soaked?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_525">
		<text>The rule out here is to watch out for number one. Do you know how many I've seen go to their deaths on some futile rescue mission? Don't try it, it's hard enough to keep yourself alive out here.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_526">
		<text>There used to be some rich pinheads who wanted to take some sort of tourist hike through Pripyat. I'm sorry to say I used to be involved in one of those gigs years back, but I stayed on the outside as a facilitator. It was fine for awhile, cash was pouring in from dumbass business executives and hedge-fund managers and our guides were pretty skilled at keeping these soft targets out of harm's way. Then, it all went up in smoke. The guide came back, all bloody and limping, and told us how they got attacked by something invisible - probably what we'd call a poltergeist these days. That was the end of that, no more vacationers.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_527">
		<text>I guess it's not all bad in the Zone sometimes. Once I found this place, I called it "my lucky spot". Whenever I would go there and sit down for awhile, close to the earth, my head would clear and I would be able to put things together in my mind that I couldn't before. I used to figure out what people would say before they said it, I knew which paths would be full of mutants, that sort of thing. One day, it just stopped working, though. I don't particularly know what it was, but I think it was a little gift from the Zone.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_528">
		<text>There was a stalker, used to drink in the Bar all day, who had the most grandiose and complex plans of fixing the Zone and making his own faction. If I remember right, his faction was going to be called "Emergence" or some shit like that; apparently, he was going to single-handedly reconcile Duty and Freedom in order to lead them on an assault to the power plant itself. His other favorite topic was about some sort of secret weapon under Iron Forest, but that guy was a total nut, so I wouldn't go looking there.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_529">
		<text>You really don't realize how much of a toll this place takes on you until you get out of here. I left the Zone a year ago because I was growing this tumor that none of the medics could fix, and I remember my first night on the outside. I found a cheap motel, locked the door and just stood under the scalding water of the shower for hours. I was crying too, but in a really mechanical and emotionless way, some sort of physical reaction to it all. I think I did that for about six hours. This place... is so opposed to the natural state of things that your body is in constant rebellion. You really only keep it together until you get a taste of what normality is supposed to be like. Sometimes, I really regret coming back but... there's just nowhere like it here.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_530">
		<text>The resurgence of the Monolith is no less than alarming. I had a friend who regularly went on expeditions deep into the Zone and usually made his home in the Outskirts. He told me that the Monolith were actually about to die out. Years ago, right after the failed military mission, they were pushed back all the way to Pripyat. The Brain Scorcher, the Miracle Machine and, if you believe some rumors, even the Wish Granter itself were all shut down. The Monolith were atrophying at an accelerated rate. Then, for a couple years, we barely heard from them - we thought they might have clocked out for good. Now, they've come out of the shadows and threaten to overrun the entirety of the southern regions. The big question is: what happened in those quiet years? Are the psy installations active once again? Or have they found another way to keep going?</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_information_531">
		<text>I really can't advise trusting in others anymore. Well, I had this business contact who had a really distinctive suit, some Clear Sky armor that he had cobbled together himself. Anyway, I just lose sight of him for a long time and he doesn't respond to my messages. I ask around and find out that he's visiting odd places and acting suspicious. I finally track him down near the northern Agroprom complex... and something's off. He runs away from my greeting, I get wise and tackle him to the ground and draw a pistol on him. I force his mask off... and it's not him. This lowlife had murdered him and then assumed his identity. He had been going around calling on favors and milking all of the connections that my friend had had, he communicated via PDA, pretending to be him... it's not an easy world out there.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_information_532">
		<text>A couple months ago, some kind of sickness appeared in the Cordon, a kind of plague. For a while, the old farmstead became a kind of sick bay for stalkers with horrifying anomalous symptoms. Like a leper colony. A medic volunteered to go in there, knowing that he would get sick too. God bless him. To think of it, the symptoms were a bit like leprosy as well.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_information_533">
		<text>I don't even recognize myself from a year ago. I came here and I believed in everything. "The Zone is a marvel! The Zone is a gift from on high, here to fix all our problems!" I can't imagine being so stupid now. Not after what I've seen... Yeah, I can't say I believe in much of anything anymore.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_information_534">
		<text>We risked our necks getting into the Zone, to see its wonders and to maybe to make some cash as well. What keeps running through in my mind... is that when we go back home, home won't be there. What if it's all Zone? All of it. Who's to say that it isn't so right now? How do you know that there's even a real world left? Fucking hell man, that scares me.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_information_535">
		<text>Looks like stalkers might be obsolete soon. My outside contact told me that the Institute is working on mechanical stalkers, machines made to go into anomalies and retrieve artefacts. From what I hear, they're almost up and running. I'd love to see one of those get dropped into the Zone, it would be shot up simultaneously by about half a dozen factions.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_information_536">
		<text>I was taking a stroll the other day while I was pissing about with my RF receiver, when I noticed a sort of unusual signal that I tracked to a covert hatch in the side of a hill that was covered with foliage. It was only locked with a padlock, so I had it open in no time and went down some dark steps into a small room filled with boxes. The boxes turned out to be full of weapons and explosives! Stranger still, some of the boxes had Arabic script on them! I decided to leave that business alone, no use in getting a price on my head. I think the SSU is up to something shifty.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_information_537">
		<text>The Zone requires every man here to perform or to die. I think that's why the gunsmiths here are perhaps the best in the entire world. They have jack-shit to work with, they have to put up with the Zone's bullshit, and despite this, they able to churn out amazing mechanical improvements that would make an engineer's head spin. Where would we be without them?</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_information_538">
		<text>We've returned to the time of legends, stalker. We had thought that modern man had annihilated the need for courage and tenacity, we thought that we could just lie in our beds while machines did things for us. No longer, my friend. The Zone has brought man's nature forth from its sleep, we are becoming strong once more. Legends are among us - who has not heard the tales of Strelok and Guide? New heroes have arisen to slay the new monsters. The spirits of Perseus and Gilgamesh walk among us.</text> 
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_information_539">
		<text>Another dawn in the Zone, another sunset. Maybe I will finally pass away one of these times. I'm hardly here anymore. I do things still: I clean my weapons, I eat, I battle against enemies... which parts are real? I don't know when I dream and when I wake. I see people, but it's difficult to remember who they are. I see those that I know to be long dead and those who may yet be alive. I have to continue on, I know that I am working towards something. What that is, I cannot say.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_information_540">
		<text>Hey, maybe just don't worry so much, ok? I can tell you hair-raising and terrible stories all day long, but I think the better thing to do is to just get a good meal, a restful night and then just go where your path takes you. We all have to die sometime, you know.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_information_541">
		<text>I've heard the rumor that there exists a subterranean Soviet garage complex that houses a T-72 in working order. Imagine that! Imagine one of the factions getting their hands on a working tank! All the rusting hulks you see around are gutted or sabotaged to shit, even if they weren't usually disabled by anomalies or radiation. But a working tank would change the game in here.</text>
	</string>

		<text>As you know, it's never a good idea to open the door while an emission is going on. Don't give into the temptation. I've heard the voices before. No, not the ones over the radio, but the ones pounding at the door, the ones that shouldn't be there. I've heard it holed-up in the middle of nowhere - hiding from a blowout and then, suddenly, a knocking at my door! A voice pleads with me, cries in agony. Don't trust it. You open the door after it's all over... and there's nothing there, no body. People have different theories: some say it's just the sound of the emission waves, others say that some psychic thing is trying to kill you, and others say it's the spirits of dead stalkers, pounding on the door. Whatever the case, never open up.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_information_543">
		<text>Well, it's pretty tough right now. On top of all the anomaly shit, you've got various killers and beasts who want to you dead. But I'm doing this all for my Ninochka, my darling! She's going to be so rich when I get out, it will be worth all the pain.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_information_544">
		<text>These artefacts... are not good for us. I'm not trying to say that they're intrinsically evil or something - honestly, I don't know. All I know is that we shouldn't be messing with them because it always tempts our worse natures and drives us into doing evil. I'm working up enough resolve to follow my conscience, I'm just way too mixed up in them right now. Pray for me, stalker.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_information_545">
		<text>This place has a way of transforming modern people into savages. I remember this corpse I saw once, way out north of the Darkscape. This stalker was dressed entirely in animal pelts, with only an old gasmask on his face to tell him apart from a caveman. He had, I shit you not, a boar spear in his hands and he looked like a person that had never been inside a house. Is this what the Zone does to people? Is this what we're headed towards when we run out of fancy tech?</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_information_546">
		<text>Some people are lucky. I won't claim that title, I think it's probably bad luck to do so. But I've witnessed some dramatic turns of fate. Like that time I was cornered by a pair of pseudodogs in a gorge and my shooter had jammed. I was done for. I take a step back... and a Whirligig throws me into the air right onto a high ledge! I didn't even see it, nor did I mind my bruised ass. Luck is the patroness of stalkers, but she's a cold bitch to be sure.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_information_547">
		<text>Ever wonder if the Zone is just one big scam? A master-strategy by the SSU? They just "accidentally" let us past the border and we dive headfirst into anomalies, emerge clutching some shiny trinket that we promptly lose by theft or trading. What if the government is just buying them up? Letting us do the dirty work and get killed while they sit back and laugh. What's in it for us? Some cheap vodka and a bullet in the back.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_information_548">
		<text>Some stalkers are just bad luck, it's like they channel the Zone's hatred. But that's not the only reason why some people are disaster-magnets - sometimes the answer is all too human. I knew this one stalker, rot in Hell, named Magpie. He told me about some artefact cache, it sounded like a great break. What a dumbass I was. He shut me in some tunnel complex near Jupiter and left me for dead, figured the mutants would just eat me alive. He grabbed some of the gear I brought and went back to tell the others that I had disappeared. Well, I actually found my way out to a different part of the Zone. I heard that dickhead got what was coming to him - screwed over one too many people. Keep an eye on your fellow stalker.</text> 
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_information_549">
		<text>There's nothing better after an exhausting dangerous trek through this God-forsaken ruin than a strong outpost where you can sit down by the fire and forget your troubles for awhile. Sleeping, eating, music... you get the occasional pushy jerk, but that's to be expected. Lots of those in the Zone. Damn, I'm tired.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_information_550">
		<text>You need a good pair of boots or you're not going to make it around here. I've seen what happens when people go around with crappy footwear - you get water, radiation and only God knows what else in your feet and it's the beginning of the end.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_information_551">
		<text>I think there are things in the Zone that we can't understand yet, things that we've only brushed up against once or twice. I've seen these things before. Well, not like actual seeing, but I've felt this thing that passed me by once - it was definitely alive and it was intelligent. It seemed to give me a look-over before passing on. I have no clue what it was and no one's ever heard of it before.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_information_552">
		<text>I remember hearing from a Duty soldier that there was this group up in Pripyat whose only purpose was to fight against the Monolith. I haven't heard of them in years, so I assume that their enemies killed them off. Funny thing is that it was apparently founded by "ex-Monolithians". I don't think such things exist.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_information_553">
		<text>Secret organizations within the Zone come and go, some are more malign than others. I bet not many people had ever heard of "Final Day" before it was destroyed. Ah, just an old ghost story.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_information_554">
		<text>Ever heard of the "Dead Fires"? The story is that some stalker is out in the Zone at night and looking for shelter when he spots a distant and lonely campfire. He comes up to it and there are some strange, quiet stalkers sitting there who seem out of place. The traveler falls asleep and awakens in the morning to find himself somewhere else; he's never able to find that place again. Sounds a bit derivative, but that's how it goes.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_information_555">
		<text>I'm here for the Oasis. Yeah, I know what you're going to say: that it isn't real, that it's a waste of time. Well, I guess I'm sorry for you. There was a rumor a while back that some scientists found a unique artefact that generated the legends, but that's just bullshit. I know someone that's been to the real place. Forget the Wish Granter, that's the real heart of the Zone, the core that all of these dangers are meant to protect.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_information_556">
		<text>Whatever you do, don't ruin your life trying to get to the Wish Granter. I should know, it almost killed me. My mind was an inch away from being lost. I wanted it more than anything, I wanted it to fix the grief that my loss gave to me. Forget it. Forget it right now. It's much easier to reconcile yourself to the world than chasing after that... that curse. Take a good look at some of those stumbling husks and consider your future.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_557">
		<text>I didn't need the money, you know. I wasn't some destitute father, driven to the Zone to trade my health for some money. This is a challenge, a journey for me. You may not believe me, but I'm actually a quite wealthy man back in the world. But the houses and the cars and the travels didn't satisfy me. I got bored with safaris, cave-diving... all so commercialized, so pedestrian. This is for real - this is life and death.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_558">
		<text>Most stalkers don't give info-gathering a second glance, but they really should. I've had far more success in finding documents about the secret operations around Chernobyl than artefact hunting. There are a surprising number of people who want to know about what the Soviets were up to back in the day. Gotta be careful who you cut deals with, though.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_559">
		<text>People don't want anything to do with you unless they think they can get some use out of you. A convenient tool, that's it. You know, I've got nothing more to say about it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_560">
		<text>The Zone is a world in itself, there's every sort of person in here. I was staying with a large group in the train tunnel in Agroprom when we get attacked by bloodsuckers during the night. We dump a huge volume of fire down the tunnel and they give up, but one of our men, just a kid really, is bleeding on the ground, a huge gash across his torso - he's not going to make it. All of the sudden, this other stalker who had been fighting at my side goes up to the kid on the ground and starts giving him last rites - he was a priest! That kid shouldn't have been in the Zone but somehow that one action made the whole situation more bearable, more human.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_561">
		<text>I once had a guy tell me about an artefact that spoke to him. After I had finished laughing, he said that it started trying to manipulate him into doing things; it didn't want to be sold, it wanted to stay. He said he ended up tossing it in some hole, he thinks it was feeding on his life-force or something. I told him he should lay off the acid.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_562">
		<text>Sometimes a quick and violent death is better. There are some stalkers that have been lost to the Zone without having to die. Some people say that there are stalkers living in the mine under Red Forest, that they had been driven there by need and had become like animals - they live in the dark, shun people and crawl on all fours. Some say they have completely lost their minds, gone feral. It's hard to separate the truth from rumor.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_563">
		<text>Everyone just thinks that they're going to get into the Zone, find their golden ticket to riches and get out. That's not how it works. It's hard to leave this place and harder to profit by it. If I had known what I was getting into, I never would have left my village, my family...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_564">
		<text>I didn't give a shit about anything before I came here, my only thought was enjoying myself as much as possible before I clocked out. That's when I woke up to the pain and the selfishness of the world, how man cannot be self-sufficient. In short, I found Christ. It was philosophy that got me there, I saw the necessity for an unchanging standard, a final cause. I don't expect you to believe, just know that there is a purpose behind it all.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_565">
		<text>It's hard for me to think of anything else besides the man who died because I fucked up. He was an old Georgian, really helpful and generous. Now he's dead and it's my fault. This fucking place. If the Wish Granter is real, that's what I'm wishing for.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_566">
		<text>I'm getting really tired of some idiots around here claiming that there's some sort of "Loner code" that we should be following. Uh, no there isn't. That's what be unaffiliated means. So no, I'm really not obliged to help you out, or swear to any set of principles.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_567">
		<text>Everyone's got their theories, their ideologies and axes to grind... Me? I just like a good drink after putting down some mutants. Nothing wrong with that.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_568">
		<text>Ah, some days I wish I was back in the Great Land, driving my BMP on maneuvers. It wasn't really that bad, was it? I could use one of those right now, drive it straight up to the plant killing those crazy bastards all the way.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_569">
		<text>There's some guy out there who is bent on killing me. No, I'm not paranoid, I know it as a fact. You see, there is a very high percentage of maniacs in the Zone and not all of them wear white camouflage. All I did was pick up this artefact I found laying around and sold it; then this crazy guy comes up to me, accusing me of stealing his stuff. He tried to kill me, but I got away. Ever since then, he's been trying to find me. He always seems to turn up wherever I go and he never stops. I don't think this will end until one of us is dead.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_570">
		<text>I used to make fun of Noah, thought he was just some religious nutjob living out his fantasies until he saved my life. Right at the worst possible time, the sirens start and we're stranded and wounded out in the marsh. Noah comes out of nowhere, takes us in and protects us from the blowout as well as a pack of snorks. He's a better man than most of the people here.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_571">
		<text>Sidorovich is a bastard, it's simple as that. But until someone else can do what he does, we're stuck with him. It's pretty typical for him to contract a hitman, knowing all the while that the killer himself is the next one on the hit-list. Few would shed tears at the news of his death.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_572">
		<text>Sometimes Barkeep is willing to fund your expedition if you want to try to open up new paths to the center. He also will let you have a look at his own intel he's built up over the years - maps and reports. Even if only one in ten efforts are successful, it's a good investment for him.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_573">
		<text>There's nothing like having a relaxing drink at the Bar, but some guys lose their way and become drunken sots. After a while, Barkeep usually throws them out - they aren't doing anyone any favors, especially themselves. It's funny: they manage to avoid the bullets and the monsters and the anomalies... but they're done in by some imported vodka.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_574">
		<text>If you're looking for a supplier near the center of the Zone, you can't go wrong with Beard. Unlike most traders in the Zone, Beard is one of us - he actually cares about the good of others, not just himself.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_575">
		<text>The Skadovsk is one of the only places in the Zone where I can relax. Beard keeps an eye on us and gives us profitable work. Although, I do miss the old days when the Monolith would stay the hell inside of Pripyat - Zaton is a dangerous neighborhood now.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_576">
		<text>Without Wolf and Fanatic around, the Rookie Village would be long gone. Those guys are the real heroes of the Zone: they give the new guys a chance. They don't have to do it, you know. What I want to know is how they manage to put up with Sidorovich's horseshit.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_577">
		<text>The northern farmstead in Cordon is sort of an outpost for the Rookie Village, but there are some tensions between Sidorovich and Loris. Obviously, Sidorovich resents any competition in his territory, but he also finds it useful to have a trading partner north of the bridge. Loris, on his part, is essential for Clear Sky stalkers passing through to the north.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_578">
		<text>After Trapper, Butcher in the Train Station is the best mutant-hunter in the Zone. I've heard that the Garbage was becoming completely overrun with mutants before he showed up and cleared them all out single-handedly.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_579">
		<text>Those stalkers at the Flea Market are almost a little faction unto themselves - they've always been secret and independent. Apparently, they've had an outpost there for many years, selling off junk from the Garbage to earn their bread. I don't fully trust them.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_580">
		<text>Forester's building is the only safe place within the nightmare of Red Forest; I have no idea how he does it, but he's been giving refuge to travelers for years, even before the Zone was around. If you ever live to see him, listen to what he has to say.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_581">
		<text>One time I was desperate enough to enter into the Arena and I barely made it back out. I really can't advise it, you shouldn't bet your life for a few roubles. If you're going to die, at least make it for something important.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_582">
		<text>When you're dealing with Snitch, you have to watch what you say. You pay him for some info, but he might be looking to make some deals off of you. One day, that stalker will piss off the wrong sort of person.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_583">
		<text>No-one's got goods like Nimble does. If you have expensive tastes and are looking for something particular, go check him out. He's been all around the Zone, but he currently resides in the Skadovsk.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_584">
		<text>I've heard that Cardan has left Zaton behind, along with his drinking problem. He lives in Yanov station now, he and Nitro have decided that two heads are better than one. Glad to see some good news in Chernobyl.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_585">
		<text>Aside from the Laundromat, those Mercs in the Bookstore constitute the other outpost in the Outskirts. Unlike other Mercs, those ones are actually willing to be reasonable. If you ask nicely, they'll even let you buy some of their top-tier equipment.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_586">
		<text>Bonesetter in Yanov station was telling me about how the road to Pripyat got opened up again. Apparently, some team of experts managed to break through the Jupiter Underground and then the new routes got discovered by Garry. I can't help but wondering if maybe those routes should have been left alone...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_587">
		<text>Guides are a strange race. They're quiet geniuses, artists who will take you through whatever the Zone has to offer without being spotted or attacked. But you better do exactly what they say when you're out in the wild; they will leave you for dead if you are stupid enough to disregard their orders.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_588">
		<text>Owl is the equipment-dealer in the Skadovsk, but many of the stalkers are uneasy about him. Some say that he was secretly working for the thugs, that he was just waiting for them to get the upper hand in Zaton before coming out in the open. But that never happened. He seems to have, reluctantly, become a true Free Stalker, but some say he still gets his supply from Bandits in Yanov.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_589">
		<text>Trapper knows more about mutants than anyone. He's hunted and killed every sort of quarry that can be found in the Zone, barring the NPP itself. He has an uncanny ability to know where to be and what to do; only a man with superhuman intuition could have survived as long as he has. Sadly, he's out of the game now - seen too many good friends get killed in terrible ways. Now he sticks to advising the stalkers of Yanov station on mutant-hunting.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_590">
		<text>Why is it that you can't find anywhere in the world without lowlife fucking thugs trying to rob and kill you? I saw them in my home town, my grandfather saw them in the gulag and here they are again. They're a human plague that must be eradicated.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_591">
		<text>Bandits are incapable of anything beyond murderous greed and petty cunning. If you get to fight them on fair terms out in the open, they usually just run away.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_592">
		<text>I've heard that the military organizes "stalker hunts" where they just roll through populated areas shooting anything in sight. I haven't seen it myself, but I don't find it hard to believe. I don't know where they find these maniacs.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_593">
		<text>How did you get through the border? My group had a contact within the border patrol: he just left a nice little hole in the fence for us to slip through. Didn't even cost that much. You can bribe one of those toads to deny his own father.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_594">
		<text>Stalkers have lots of theories about what Clear Sky is up to. Some say they just want to study the Zone in peace, while others think that they're looking for some sort of secret psy weapon to control the Monolith. As for myself, I just think they're desperately trying to survive.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_595">
		<text>Good for the Ecologists, they got into the Zone in the proper way; they're like respectable stalkers. Well, such a life is not for me, to be honest. I'd rather make my own way.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_596">
		<text>Ecologists offered me a job to go down into a lab to get some samples for them. I offered that they could piss off, what kind of moron do you have to be to go for that job? Still... the fee was pretty tempting...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_597">
		<text>Those Duty guys seem a bit full of themselves. Maybe they've got a point with the mutants, but surely there's nothing wrong with collecting artefacts? Anyway, I'm glad they keep an eye on Rostok.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_598">
		<text>I've thought of joining Duty a couple times - never went through with it, though. I see enough mutant activity without going out to seek it myself. No thanks.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_599">
		<text>Freedom seems like a mixed lot. I've had them point me to some good artefact spots and they told me the tricks to the anomalies too. On the other hand, so many of them are just degenerates who let Bandits have a free reign in their territory.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_600">
		<text>I think Freedom's whole mission is idiotic. Have you seen the miracles and wonders of the Zone? I've only seen death and abominations of thermodynamics. The best thing you can expect from the Zone is a good payout. Honestly, I'd rather just avoid getting mixed up in Duty or Freedom.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_601">
		<text>Rumors say that there's an interrogation chamber beneath the Merc base in Dead City. Sometimes, they grab people who have special intel and take them there. I heard they torture them for years if need be. Stay away from those Mercs.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_602">
		<text>The Mercenaries of today have little in common with their contracted predecessors in the earlier years. They're no longer fragmented temporary operations working towards their own ends. Some sort of shadowy campaign took place under Dushman that consolidated the seperate groups and kicked out the ones who didn't want to play nice. Some groups, like Hatchet's men, just left when things started heating up. On the other hand, Hook's soldiers had to be wiped out. Now they're a centralized private army, and we should be very wary.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_603">
		<text>You're talkative for Clear Sky. I like to think that we're on the same side, fighting a common enemy. You know, you can be off-putting with all your secretiveness; makes some stalkers a bit jumpy.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_604">
		<text>Ah, now you want something from us, huh? You're usually just fine shooting loners on sight. All I have to say is that you better keep your shooter holstered around us, or you're going to go missing.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_605">
		<text>Stalkers and Ecologists should stick it out together - we're an ecosystem. You enjoy having a good supply of rare artefacts from all over the Zone and we enjoy a nice paycheck now and then.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_606">
		<text>I think you scientists actually could learn a thing or two from us humble stalkers. We might not have your college degrees or government equipment, but every stalker who's brought back an artefact alive has more experience than all your PhDs put together.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_607">
		<text>More Free Stalkers should be grateful to what you've done for us. Thanks to you, Rostok is the best place in the Zone. You could really clean up the Garbage though, it's getting wild and dangerous again.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_608">
		<text>Man, what happened to Duty? Where did all your territory go? There seems to be so few of you left. I hear rumors about Shulga and his men sometimes. Usually that they're holed-up somewhere in Pripyat, but I don't see it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_609">
		<text>Hey, good for you with maintaining the Barrier; most groups would avoid such a dangerous task. I heard that the attacks from Radar are growing more frequent and I'd rather not see Monolith patrolling Cordon.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_610">
		<text>Here's some info: some of your goons stole my shit. I mean, what the hell? Are you letting thugs into your ranks now?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_611">
		<text>You look just like the Merc who killed my buddies. I never know what you people are about, one day you're taking out hits and the next day you're chatting us up. What are you here for?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_612">
		<text>Free Stalkers should stick together, right? I hate hearing about how loners screw eachother over - aren't there enough dangers in the Zone?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_613">
		<text>Loners are looking more like a faction every day: leaders, objectives... I guess it has to be that way now. I wouldn't be surprised if some new group got formed, like "True Loners" or something like that.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_614">
		<text>Other groups have just got things all wrong. They think the best way to handle the Zone is to make the Zone more like the outside world. Your faction won't save you! It's going to decay and corrupt, like everything else around here. What you choose as a person is what counts: bravery or cowardice, foolishness or wisdom...</text>

	<string id="dm_information_615">
		<text>Having a sixth sense is helpful in the Zone, sometimes it's the only help you have. I was walking along one day when I just felt off, something seemed wrong. I acted on the feeling and climbed up onto a tree limb - just in time! Immediately, a huge pack of blind dogs runs by - must have been 30 of them! Two lessons: trust your gut and put a high ledge between you and those mongrels.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_616">
		<text>The more we learn how to control the Zone, the more it learns how to break free. Bloodsuckers are bad enough, but what about these new monstrosities? I've heard them called psysuckers, but most people like to avoid talking about them altogether. Even in the middle of camp, you can't feel safe.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_617">
		<text>If you see some sort of massive splotch crawling around in the distance, just get out of there before it sees you. Those who underestimate pseudogiants are never seen again. You think you can outrun them, right? Then you realize that they can crawl forever and they won't stop once they've seen you. They'll wear you down and then rip you apart.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_618">
		<text>Where the hell do these walking corpses keep coming from? I don't mean our unfortunate stalker friends, it's pretty clear where they came from. I mean those ones who were brought here for experiments by the old scientists. It really makes one wonder about the extent of the testing done in the labs.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_619">
		<text>The flesh is a pretty extreme example of what the Zone can do to biological life. However, I think that they actually might be the next step in the evolutionary ladder. See how quickly they've developed effective adaptations to the environment? Are you aware that the flesh's combination of sensory organs, protective qualities and problem-solving behavior is unrivaled in the natural world? Maybe I need to stop thinking about this.</text>

		<text>Fleshes are the horrible genetic refuse of the Zone, just biological trash. They're just so fucked-up and miserable. It's a good idea to put them out of their misery whenever you see them.</text>

	<string id="dm_information_621">
		<text>Ever seen one of those evil little goblin things? Karliks? I found one hiding in Yantar and I filled it with lead. I wish I had never set eyes on it. Thing is, it's still taking out its revenge. It got into my head somehow. I can't go anywhere alone without seeing little grinning skulls in the corner of my eye, I feel it watching me all the time. The worst shit in the Zone are those mind-altering freaks out there... I can't even get any sleep anymore.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_622">
		<text>It's wise to fear not the strongest enemy, but the smartest one. And I think controllers are the smartest, more than us, maybe. I heard this story from a Freedomer years back about some controller that pretended to be a stalker. It was wearing a hooded coat and it walked right into the Freedom base - the guards got their heads scrambled by its psy field and they didn't notice it. Then it just wreaked havoc. Can you even imagine that?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_623">
		<text>How about a cautionary tale? A buddy of mine was drinking with his group around the campfire when he fell asleep for the night. He woke up and he was out in the dark, being dragged along the ground by his foot. He looks down and a huge nasty cat is pulling him along! Luckily, he had his pistol on him.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_624">
		<text>Those lurker things are becoming more and more of a problem. Before, they were just a sort of campfire story from stalkers returning from Pripyat. Now, even experienced stalkers are going missing, only to turn up later mauled and shredded. Those monsters don't even need to eat, they just kill for sport.</text>

		<text>Chernobog, Mokosh honor him, is not dead, but he lives on through the emanations of the Zone. He has simply been deified by Charenza into a greater unity with the Eternal One. As the Zone grows on earth, so also does he.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_626">
		<text>The secrets of the Masters are the path towards reunification with the all-encompassing nothing. Read them! There is Master Triglav of the High Molecular Nucleophysics, Master Dazhbog of Discrete Energy Fields, Master Perun of the Emerging Enzymology and many more. Only those who delve into the secrets are able to dissolve into the Vyraj.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_627">
		<text>Surely you are an initiate? When is the last time you took in the Elixir? You must take it consistently for the subdeification to take place! You must make sure that your volkhv is not lax in this respect!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_628">
		<text>The most experienced among the volkhv usually make a somatic sacrifice, although "sacrifice" is not precisely the right word. The self-inflicted privation is a declaration against the evil of the material world; as all things not in Vyraj are worthless, the deformation of physical matter is a noble commitment to the cause of the Zone. Many remove fingers, but some also remove eyes or genitals.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_629">
		<text>Always the world of creation has been a thorn to us, taunting with its blinding lights, pleasures and pains, all of the fucking people with smug and smiling faces. The Zone is the ultimate affront to that, a middle finger in the face of the world. As the Zone manifests Vyraj in this worthless world, the very fabric of this place is corrupted and tortured. And corrupted evil is nothing but goodness.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_630">
		<text>Let alone the children of the Zone, the ones that have been endowed with a vision of the coming reality. The feeble-minded call them mutants, but their very corrupted and twisted nature makes them a testament to Vyraj. Some of them have been given the knowledge to understand the cause of Vyraj and they may see us as allies; others are so alike to us that we consider them brothers.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_631">
		<text>The ultimate truth is the nothingness of the One, and reason is shit before it. Reason is a silly invention by those living in this fantasy world, it damns the mind into pathetic submission to a false god. Talk to Gnomoslava, he will help you wish for the void.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_632">
		<text>As the Zone expands, so also will the illusion of reality melt into nothing. First we will overthrow the Christians, then the Muslim God will fall, and then the Hebrew God will be cast down and forgotten. The world will no longer be. There will be nothing but the blinding void before the eternal vision of all.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_633">
		<text>Initiates may be content with killing the enemies of the Zone, but the volkhvs who are worthy enough desire a closer dissipation into the Zone. I have seen them go out into the Psy storm, they welcomed in the dead vitality of the Zone and its power of self-dissolving. They gained powers that have made them a terror to our enemies. They say the great Chernobog welcomed in the noble Emissions as well.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_634">
		<text>As you stay with us, you will realize the fecundity of the Zone, how it takes from us and gives what is not expected. Mostly, you will lose superficiality and the concreteness of self; this may be painful at first, but all illusions are pain until you escape them. What you will gain is difficult to accept. You have seen our great ones wade through bullets and bombs like water, and they have little need to sleep. What you will become is only self-evident upon your deification into the further grades.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_635">
		<text>In the ages past those Believers gave us names, heathen or heretic they called us. They were right. Heresy, so called by them, was really just a name for the way of things. Those fucking simpletons were blind enough to believe in one reality, unchanging and eternal - slaves to the illusion! The only reality is in the chaotic change of what is naively named "truth". Make no mistake, Vyraj is no sort of "heaven", but rather the death of heaven. There we will find the removal of sin, indeed, but also the entire obliteration of all things. If there is no meaning, then sin can not exist.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_636">
		<text>Perhaps you have been in battle for the cause of the Zone? Many of the initiates find pain difficult, but it does not need to be so. Of course, suffering is an illusion, a play of shadows by this evil world. Accepting this is necessary to initiation in a higher grade. One of our dear brothers, Bezlaya, was gravely disabled by some of the Zone-deniers. His arm, if there is such a thing, was hanging by a strip of flesh and there was fragmentation throughout his abdomen. He felt no pain, there was no pain for him because he escaped the illusion. But he was a mighty volkhv, deeply learned in the wisdom of Zlebog.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_637">
		<text>The Masters' work is continued through us. The great irony of their lives is that they thought that they failed. They thought the intersection of the Zone with the unclean reality was a mistake. However, some later learned that they had received just what they wanted. They wanted to eliminate the sins of the world, but they did not realize how this was to be done. As we know, it is the effacement of the world by the introduction of Vyraj. As the Zone grows, the plan of the Masters will be fulfilled.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_638">
		<text>The Elixir is an art that requires much reading of the Masters and even our volkhvs may make mistakes. One initiate, who was in fact a volunteer from the Zone-foes, was most adversely effected by the tainted serum; he became incredibly agitated and his facial muscles began to liquidate. As we do in all such cases, he was cast into the Crushing Svet and consumed. That is the best we can do for them - a mere approximation to the effacement of entering Vyraj willingly.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_639">
		<text>I don't know what to believe of these rumors of treason against the Zone. Some say that an initiate of the Zhenik grade willingly tried to sabotage the cause of the Zone through deception. As he was found to have regressed to a worldling, he was forced into the Burning Razrushetyel as a statement against the False Reality.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_640">
		<text>Those new initiates were captives, right? Well, they need a thorough Enlightening or we'll run into more problems again. I say, give them a double dose of the fucking elixir. No more mistakes.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_641">
		<text>This I have learned from the effaced Znagomil: there was once a sect of the wicked Zone-deniers that was more direct than the rest, even more than the current sect called "Dolg". This group was formed in order to oppose the Zone, to destroy it even. This is why they took on themselves the name "Final Day", but it was not our final day but theirs. Right before the mighty Chernobog was to destroy them, an unknown man killed the accursed leader and vanished. This is when the noble Chernobog learned to let the enemies of the coming Zone fight amongst themselves.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_642">
		<text>Ah, I think I need a more acute enlightenment. Sometimes I see my former self and remember my former comrades - no, stop! It wasn't real, it was a goddamn illusion from a shitty lie. They're not real any more than I am. Vyraj, please come and blot out my existence!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_643">
		<text>Every time you feel the noble Emission gathering up, focus upon the expansion of the Zone, visualize the growth of the realm of Vyraj. Unite your will that it may be overrun by the power coming through. Think of it growing until it consumes the earth! Think it before your mind is taken.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_644">
		<text>The great Master Berstuk created our forefathers. He took vile worldlings, living in an evil illusion, and opened their inmost eye to the blinding void. We were formed in the dark chasms below the mighty labs and the Tower to the Abyss. Many who were taken there were not as lucky, they simply became beasts or imbeciles, although gifted with the wonders of the Zone. Even now, Mighty Berstuk rides the Emission waves, seeking to extend the realm.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_645">
		<text>Ever hear of the Gromi? They were initiates like us, but given over to special powers when they underwent a deification. I knew one brother, Oleg Mithras, who was entrusted with the power of calling down an Emission - what a gift! Or Timur Magus, who was able to bring about the slow death of any man that he had seen. As for myself, I'm just a humble servant, happy with shooting those bitches who dare oppose the Zone.</text> 
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_646">
		<text>Ask that the Zone may curse your bullets, that being sped from the weapon of a servant of the Zone, it may find itself in the vital organs of the enemy. May they die in pain and their own shit - that's a mercy compared to those who oppose the coming of Vyraj.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_647">
		<text>The Strelok is the great enemy, the one who opposes the new Void. Belbog, grievously maim the Strelok! Svetovid, blast the Strelok with burning fire! Triglav, wipe the name of Strelok from all worlds! All Zirnitri, heap black death on the Strelok!</text>

	<string id="dm_information_648">
		<text>Our Monolith comrades have valiantly defended the heart of the living Zone for many years, may their total dissolution be soon! They were not given the secrets that our fathers were given, however, and they know little of the coming Zone, they only know to defend the center against enemies. On the other hand, the Zone has blessed them with the blotting out of person-hood.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_649">
		<text>The mighty Monolith is the shield of the Zone, they defend the great works that spread the realm of the coming Void. We are the spear of Vyraj, the herald of the true nothingness bearing down upon the false reality.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_650">
		<text>Do us all a favor and try to keep them alive. Shoot out the knees or put one in the gut, once they get the serum, they'll be stabilized. We need to be more crafty in the field, we can't take many more from those Bandit fuckers without them noticing.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_651">
		<text>It's hard for me to believe that I used to have material wants, that I even desired person-hood... There's nothing left for us to do but to bring about the final night, the victory of the Zone over all creation.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_652">
		<text>Laugh at all the shitheel little sects - all a company of fools. The Zone grows in strength and nothing can be done by their puny strength. The volkhvs are all in agreement, the final strike will come soon and then the present Zone will be cleared from enemies.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_653">
		<text>Factions, governments and churches will all oppose us to no avail. They will realize, all too late, that the day they have always dreaded will have come. They have many sins, but there is no sin more vile than existing in this putrid reality, desiring as a conscious entity... the Zone will crush them all into the cold earth.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_654">
		<text>Look into the face of the wonders, the very eyes of our beloved Masters! Their dream is nearly a reality. The night-army is prepared, the Zone will soon awake and stretch. I have ascended only to a low grade, but I will impale myself on their swords if the Zone may expand.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_655">
		<text>Why do you spend your efforts in containing the Zone? Why don't you try to help it grow? Most of the world recognizes the inherent value of the Zone; we simply want to share that value with the world.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_656">
		<text>It's a tragedy that you have had so much ill-will with the Monolith, but you must realize that they are only a defense mechanism. It was, after all, the stalkers that first encroached upon the heart of the Zone.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_657">
		<text>It's silly to try to stop the growth of the Zone. Don't you see it ever growing? The Zone doesn't recede, it can't. So why fight it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_658">
		<text>Control over the Zone cannot happen, it is a beast you cannot tame. Why don't you let it tame you instead? Why don't you just allow it wash over you? To take away all of the hurt, all of the anxiety? It can do that, you know.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_659">
		<text>Why don't you join us as a respected comrade? Isn't it time that you stopped fighting for hypocrites, or even for your own greed? Sin seeks to give the world what it deserves: utter purification.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_660">
		<text>Why do you continue to fight for scum-sucking hypocritical bastards? Duty, Freedom, the army, it's all the same - you know that. You have seen the futility of what human leadership will give you. Just join up with us, do the right thing.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_661">
		<text>Surely you have seen the wonders of the Zone? The coarse-minded call them dangers or aberrations, but those are the words of a narrow mind; would the same people reject fire because it can burn? No, you aren't like that - you have come to see the miracle and the beauty within the various expressions of the Zone. What's next? Well, the Zone should scatter its treasures all over the world, right? You have to be a real blind bastard to oppose that. That's what Sin is about, that's all we're trying to do.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_662">
		<text>What is seen cannot be unseen. When you entered this place, weren't you struck with the aggressive vitality of the Zone? Its power? When you see past the tricks of light, the impressions upon a novice mind, you will see the living purpose that is manifested in the Zone. We simply call that Vyraj.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_663">
		<text>It is really in your best interest to make peace with the cause of the Zone - that's all we're here to facilitate. Don't you fear the Monolith? Doesn't it seem inevitable that they will triumph? Everyone says so. Do the wise thing and enter Sin as a friend. The Monolith leave us in peace, we have no fear. Isn't that something you want?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_664">
		<text>Well congratulations on being in the Zone! That really is a start! You know, some hide away from this place - in their narrow minds, they want to avoid anything that threatens their selfish peace. You are here, however, and that means that you must have felt some sort of draw or fascination to the Zone. Even if it was personal gain, certainly you now see the Zone as something worth preserving? If you wish to help preserve it, please see one of our leaders and speak with them.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_665">
		<text>Greetings, cousin. How goes the battle for the cause? If you need some some sort of aid, go see one of the volkhvs in Red Forest.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_666">
		<text>May the Zone efface your soul, friend. You are the watchmen of the realm of the Zone and you cannot fail. The Masters are depending upon your dedication.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_667">
		<text>We should not work in estrangement, but we should fight shoulder to shoulder against the foes of the Zone! Well... the volkhvs have always counseled caution and so they wish us to conceal our friendship with the great Monolith. As we go out among the Zone-deniers, we must gain bodies for our cause, so discretion is wise.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_668">
		<text>How great is the progress of the Monolith! Your arms have carried you far beyond the City, out into the very heartland of the Zone-foes! We are ever glad to assist you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_669">
		<text>Chernobog was wise to make common cause with so mighty a host as the Monolith. Are we not brothers in spirit? You seek to preserve the noble Zone and we seek to see it grow. No doubt our work is in much of the same.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_670">
		<text>I was recently initiated into the Zone and it pains me to think of all of the evil said about the Monolith. Do they not know that it was the Zone-foes who struck at the heart of the Zone without cause? They live in ignorance and misery, death should be a solace for them.</text> 
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_671">
		<text>When is the next shipment of armament coming? We do not fail in regards to will or tenacity, but we are running low on munitions. Although Stribog has rightly advised us to go into the camps of the Zone-deniers and cut their throats while they sleep. Although not all make it back, it is good work.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_672">
		<text>Didn't it seem like the last Emission expanded the borders of the Zone? I think it did, even if just a meter. Every footstep taken by the Zone is one that cannot be released.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_673">
		<text>I was told to collect the fingers of dead enemies by Mentor. When I look at them, I am reminded of the imminent victory of the Zone and of the worthlessness of our own flesh. You are lucky, my friend, because you have few thoughts to trouble your calm.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_674">
		<text>Just yesterday, Stribog was telling me of the great victory of the eternal Monolith over the worthless sect "Clear Sky". It was then that the Zone-foes rose up against us in strength, with the intention of casting the Zone back to the outer darkness. When it seemed most in doubt, the Zone prevailed! It will be so in the future.</text>

		<text>This place is entirely baffling to me. We had all thought that the Chernobyl situation was a bunch of hearsay blown way out of proportion by gullible news agencies. I expected to find strange radiation patterns and maybe some sort of erratic meteorology. I can't believe how wrong I was...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_676">
		<text>I remember seeing my first anomaly, really not that long ago. I just stared at it, dumbstruck, wondering how such a thing could happen on our orderly and explainable planet. This place is the future - the tests you could run here make the majority of the research world obsolete.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_677">
		<text>There's no doubt this is the worst place for a military expedition I've ever heard of. We've got terrible supply chains, spotty communication, outdated intel on the land and we're surrounded by hostile armed forces that we don't even understand. This makes me wish I was back in the Balkans.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_678">
		<text>Attrition is bad here, really bad. We should not be going out after dark or in places we haven't studied first. We're losing more people every day and half of the time I don't know what to write on their death reports.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_679">
		<text>I only wish that we got here before anyone else. It's a full-time job to deal with the aggressive fauna and environmental dangers, but this place is world-class conflict zone! If the council wanted to get a handle on this place, I think they would need to increase our numbers tenfold.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_680">
		<text>Don't trust those stalkers. Never let your guard down around them. We've penetrated into a war-zone situation and we don't even know the players involved. You never know which of these people are working for a criminal underworld or some extreme paramilitary group. One thing I know: you can't bargain with the ones dressed in white. Shoot them on sight.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_681">
		<text>This is a fucking suicide mission. We lost a whole research team last week when they were cannibalized by some sort of bloodsucking feral humans. That was certainly not in the briefing. We're completely blind in here, just waiting for the next superhuman predator to find us.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_682">
		<text>The Zone of Exclusion seems to be divided into several territories controlled by armed factions. As we entered in an organized fashion, the "stalkers" here viewed us as just another faction to compete with. We don't have the numbers or the intel to defend ourselves from every side, so it is of the utmost importance that we form alliances with particular groups. We just need to figure out which ones are trustworthy enough and which are entirely insane.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_683">
		<text>There is absolutely no way that an entire ecosystem could mutate to this state in a matter of decades from radiation alone. Impossible! I have experience in genetics and behavioral biology, and the most we should be seeing now are abnormal growths and more aggressive behavior. That's a bit of an understatement! This is a wildly transformed ecosystem that appears to contain new species with abilities found nowhere in the natural world. We need to get to the bottom of this, this is unheard of.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_684">
		<text>I have never seen a more hostile environment and I spent time in Bosnia and Afghanistan. Every other encounter turns into a ruthless firefight and most of the OPFOR in this nuthouse are armed with military-grade equipment and a sophisticated organization. This is the most lawless place on earth and I have no idea what we can do here.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_685">
		<text>If you see an area with anomalous activity, mark it on your PDA and we'll send a team out when we can. We're getting quite a backlog of these things, but we need to start forming accurate maps.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_686">
		<text>Last thing I heard from battalion was that the supply shipment is delayed due to weather. I think "weather" might be a code-word for something else. It feels like we're a million miles away from the rest of the world.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_information_687">
		<text>I sure as hell don't like the look of some of the guys they tacked on to our company: quiet types with scars and a superior attitude. Why did the Research Commission think that we needed these kinds of people? Some of them seem to be itching to get in a fight.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_information_688">
		<text>I think you better toughen up because otherwise you can't last long out here. Even if you dodge the Ukrainian Army, there are hostiles in here that would give the SAS a run for their money. Just the other day a squad was tracked back to a FOP and they nearly got wiped out.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_information_689">
		<text>We desperately need to get some of those special research suits from the Ukrainians. I keep hearing about our researchers who have their protective gear fail on them - some of them are no longer with us. Our equipment is hopelessly inadequate against these new hazards.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_information_690">
		<text>I didn't believe the early reports about killer animals around the Zone - I just thought that some frightened scientists saw a rabid dog or something. Now I've seen things with my own eyes that people back in the world wouldn't believe. The worst thing is that I don't know if the things that I've seen were human or... something else. This place is some kind of nightmare.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_information_691">
		<text>I've been out gathering info from among the locals and I can tell you that the Research Commission doesn't know anything about the nature of this place. We were told that we were going in to observe radiological weather anomalies resulting from the Chernobyl nuclear disasters. The stalkers I've been talking with have hinted at things we've never dreamed of: secret biological testing in underground labs and some sort of newly discovered energy field. Usually they don't like to talk much on these topics, makes them jumpy. I'm going to have to look into one of these underground facilities myself.</text>

		<text>I've been contracted with the UN since the Mozambique Civil War in the 90s. After the Gulf war, all of the conflict zones sort of just meld together in my mind. I'm not the kind of soldier that gets in the newspaper photos with the blue helmet on. They call on people like me when things just need to go smoother and an operation needs to look cleaner. Well, I think this is my kind of place. No more pussyfooting around, no genocidal civilians and no journalists crying war crimes. This is what I'm good at.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_information_693">
		<text>All of those scientific journals coming out of Eastern Europe are starting to make sense now - the amazing insights into physics and the baffling partly-redacted experiments. We thought that we had fallen behind, that we were getting soft. Now it makes sense. These people thought that they could just keep this scientific goldmine for themselves. Hopefully this expedition will just be the first; after the Zone is pacified, we can set up some installations in here. No more secrets.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_information_694">
		<text>We were in the fourth pathfinder group, right after the one that went missing entirely. We had only managed to get one local guide who was willing, some alcoholic Russian with a bad attitude, in addition to our new satellite imagery. As everyone found out, the sat-maps were completely useless and we had to depend on our sullen guide. Three days in, he tells us to stop, that we can't go straight ahead and that we would have to make a huge detour. We were ready to listen, but a couple of the macho task force scouts insisted on going ahead. We heard screams that night and we couldn't re-establish contact. After that, there was no more complaining about the guide. I think the commander even doubled his fee.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_695">
		<text>Well, I'm getting a good idea what happened to that previous expedition years back. It was such a mystery when they went missing, we didn't have a clue. I get it now. For myself, I think one of those Emissions did them in - they can wipe out a whole column before we can even get move authorization from Field-Ops.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_696">
		<text>I think it's time to alert the Security Council about the situation in here. Not only are Ukrainian troops firing on us in the broad daylight, but there's an entire war-zone out here being waged by paramilitary groups. People need to know about this!</text>

		<text>Ever see one of the stalkers gather artefacts from an anomaly zone? It's amazing. They go in there and some of them are only wearing a leather coat and an old Soviet mask and they start throwing small objects to mark dangerous spots. It's ingenious! Many of them don't even use detectors! I heard the Research Commission's not even made any progress with artefact sensing.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_698">
		<text>I've heard some of the locals here talk about a "Wish Granter" that supposedly exists somewhere in here and... well, grants wishes. I suppose I should have guessed that such a chaotic and extreme environment as this would produce it's own myths along with actual scientific phenomena.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_699">
		<text>You should have been there when the Field-Ops command was getting communications from that task force sweeping a warehouse - they were cut to pieces. It was chilling stuff and the operations staff were completely at a loss - I've never seen such helplessness. The field team was just screaming into the microphone about a hostile ambush from all sides, grenades and automatic weaponry. We thought it might be the Ukrainians, but then we heard some sort of insane chanting over the microphones of our dead insertion team. I remember the faces of those officers when they had to make a translation for the Ops commander: "You should not have come here. You will die here, under our feet. The Monolith has spoken."</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_700">
		<text>I would like to convey the wishes of the Research Commission by saying that we are grateful for any and all cooperation from local stalkers and we are more than willing to render our assistance to you in return. The hostilities need to stop.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_701">
		<text>Until we develop the equipment and methodology needed for large-scale artefact gathering, we would be very grateful to pay for any objects that come into our possession through other means. If you do have something to give us, please also provide a safe container for it, as we are in short supply of those for the moment.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_702">
		<text>I'm just relieved to see a friendly face! You know, I've been to some pretty violent places, but I've never even heard of hostility like this. Please try to convince your fellow Zoners that we are simply here to study and report, nothing else.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_703">
		<text>Well, don't be shocked when I say that I don't trust you very much. It's people like you that have been cutting us to pieces without provocation ever since we got here. It's no great wonder why we've been more peremptory in our security measures.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_704">
		<text>I should really be asking you for information. Ever since I arrived here a couple weeks ago, everything I've seen has been inexplicable or dangerous and usually both. Is it true that the paramilitary group that holds the power plant is altering the minds of their recruits to make them more fanatical? Seems a bit far-fetched to me...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_705">
		<text>We would rather not have you hanging around here. No offense, but we've been burned too often in the past by strangers. Unless you can prove that you're with us, it's better that you just keep your distance.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_706">
		<text>Our mission isn't to carve out a little kingdom in the Zone; we don't even want to stop your kind from continuing your business here. We are simply here to study so that we can enrich the collective knowledge of the world. Maybe you should tell your friends that.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_707">
		<text>We had no idea that this place would be such a madhouse. We certainly didn't expect the scale and potency of the scientific phenomena here, and even less the savage armed resistance we would encounter. Do you wonder why we've had to fight back? To be more aggressive?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_708">
		<text>Don't mess with us. It's not worth it. Just let us conduct or business here while you conduct yours. If you or your friends try anything funny, they might not like what they call up.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_709">
		<text>There are many stalkers here who have an impressive store of knowledge and experience with the Zone. If you're well informed and want to help us out, why don't you consider becoming an advisor? Don't you think it would be good to help out a noble cause? We can pay you as well.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_710">
		<text>Aren't you sick of the Army's horseshit? Wouldn't you rather have a less corrupt organization running things in the Zone? I'm not saying that UNISG will be necessarily in charge here, but the situation with the military accepting bribes on one hand and gunning down innocent stalkers on the other... it doesn't have to be like this.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_711">
		<text>Hey, why don't you give us a hand against Kuznetsov and his thugs? They've been squatting on this place for too long, abusing anyone who doesn't want to play along with their corrupt and unfair way of doing things. Must be hell, always having those goons gunning for you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_712">
		<text>I think your people and my people could have some very productive collaborations. I think we could both use a little help against some common enemies. Don't you think?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_713">
		<text>You know, I used to be just like you. Hired gun, soldier of fortune, all that shit. Not a very romantic life, right? Well I'm not bullshitting when I say that life is much better over where I am. In these sorts of situations, they usually turn a blind eye to whatever we do.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_714">
		<text>We could really use some people like you. Most of the stalkers we run across in this shit-hole are knuckle-dragging thugs with just enough brain-cells to operate a gun. As I'm sure you know, what the Zone really needs is study and intelligent thought. I can't imagine having to work for the corrupt army thugs - no better than the street-trash that you find around here.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_715">
		<text>You know those mutants that look like zombies but crawl on all fours? Izloms, or Fractures, they're called. Creepy bastards, with long arms and legs that look like they've been snapped in multiple places. But that's not the only reason they're called Fractures. They're a lot stronger than they look. I hear that if one gets a good hold on you, it can snap your bones like sticks.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_716">
		<text>Somebody was talking about a whole society of dwarfs living under the Zone, short people who can make weapons. I've never seen someone so high in my life.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_717">
		<text>Word of advice, never trust cars in the Zone. It's like they explode if you bump into a pebble.</text>

		<text>Know anything useful?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_tips_general_2">
		<text>How do you manage to stay alive here?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_tips_general_3">
		<text>What kind of advice can you give about the Zone?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_tips_0">
		<text>I really don't have any advice to give you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_tips_1">
		<text>You shoot a guy in the face a couple times, and he's finished. It won't matter what he's wearing as long as it ain't an exo.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_tips_2">
		<text>Use a grenade or two to get a guy to shift his ass. He won't be hiding there much longer if he sees a pineapple roll up next to him.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_tips_3">
		<text>If you have a fast enough trigger finger, you can fire off both barrels of a shotgun at the same time. Keep that in mind if you run into a bloodsucker.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_tips_4">
		<text>Don't underestimate pistols, stalker. They're pretty handy if you ain't got much ammo left for your main shooter, and they'll waste anything with light armour.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_tips_5">
		<text>If you're running a hit, you can waste the poor bastard without being seen using a sniper rifle; you'll be able to whack him from much further than with your other shooters.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_tips_6">
		<text>You ain't gonna be able to hit shit if you're running while shooting. Find some cover to hide behind and lean out to shoot; you'll be far more accurate.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_tips_7">
		<text>Keep your gear in good condition. Your gun will jam and your suit will be full of holes if you don't see a technician every now and then.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_tips_8">
		<text>Last time I went to see a technician, he couldn't upgrade half my shit... Asked me to go out and fetch tools for him. What, am I his errand boy now?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_tips_9">
		<text>Ever met a guy who stood outside during an emission? Of course you haven't! Hide your ass whenever one hits unless you feel like having your brain boiled.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_tips_10">
		<text>Almost lost my legs the other day. Planted a whole cluster of butterfly mines to cover my ass when scavenging and forgot about them on my way back. They'll go off no matter who planted 'em.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_tips_11">
		<text>Just because the trader don't have a job for you doesn't mean none of us do. You can make some good money running errands for others. Might find some good loot in the meantime, too.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_tips_12">
		<text>Keep hold of any meds you might find; you never know when they might be useful. Hercules is pretty good when you're hauling goods, and psi-block will help you against any controllers.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_tips_13">
		<text>Carry some spare ammo on you even if you don't think you need it. Nothing worse than having to fight off a horde of mutants with just your blade.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_tips_14">
		<text>You tried artefact hunting? Get a detector and go near some anomalous area; if the thing starts bleeping at you, then there's one nearby. Though you'll need one of the expensive models to find the good shit.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_tips_15">
		<text>Don't run face first straight into an anomaly. If you think there's one nearby, toss a few bolts at it. Rather the bolts than you, right?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_tips_16">
		<text>If you ain't feeling too good, then try eating some food. Might not have the same effect as a medkit, but it'll perk you up enough to keep you going.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_tips_17">
		<text>Don't ignore your PDA. It'll keep track of your tasks and help you find your way around the Zone if you're lost or planning on going somewhere.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_tips_18">
		<text>Holster that shooter if you're going to talk to someone. Nobody likes having the end of a barrel being waved in front of their face.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_tips_19">
		<text>Make sure to pack energy drinks with you. They'll come in handy if you keep tiring out when carrying loot back to camp.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_tips_20">
		<text>If your helmet has night vision, make sure to upgrade it. You'll be able to see further and clearer if you let a technician screw around with it for some cash.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_tips_21">
		<text>You aren't defenceless if you're out artefact hunting. So what if you're carrying your detector? You can still hold a pistol in the other hand.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_tips_22">
		<text>Plenty of places to sleep at if you need to pass the time. There's always a free bed at most camps, but you can take a sleeping bag out with you anywhere.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_tips_23">
		<text>Artefacts aren't all good news; they'll kill you slowly with their radiation unless you're protected. Keep in mind that there are artefacts which can absorb radiation, too, though.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_tips_24">
		<text>Your knife ain't just a weapon for sneaking up on people with; you can bust open boxes, chests, and locks with it, too. Who knows, might find something cool inside...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_tips_25">
		<text>If you keep finding yourself running out of breath, then stop carrying so much shit. You can stash it away somewhere in a backpack, or sell it to a trader.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_tips_26">
		<text>If you want meds, then go see a medic, and if you want booze, then go see barkeep; a lot of traders out here specialise in certain types of goods.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_tips_27">
		<text>You won't find artefacts at the same place all the time; they all change about after an emission. Remember that next time you're near an anomaly.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_tips_28">
		<text>The Zone has a life of its own, stalker. Just because there weren't any freaks about the last time you went some place doesn't mean they haven't moved in since.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_tips_29">
		<text>If you ain't got nothin' to deal with radiation poisoning, then try to keep yourself alive until you can reach a medic. But then ask yourself: why aren't you carrying any vodka?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_tips_30">
		<text>Run and jump if something looks too far away; your momentum will carry you farther. Easy way to get away from some muties, as they won't think to jump over shit.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_tips_31">
		<text>Selling artefacts isn't the only way to make some cash: offloading unneeded equipment can be a profitable business, too. Keep in mind that traders aren't usually interested in items that are broke.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_tips_32">
		<text>Crouch and sneak about if you don't wanna get seen or heard. Not every battle is worth fighting, or maybe you just want to get the jump on someone?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_tips_33">
		<text>You can attach scopes and launchers to your shooter, y'know? You'll have to find or purchase the parts yourself, but they're well worth it. Scopes let you engage with accuracy from much further away, while underbarrel launchers let you keep a tonne of explosive hurt on standby for emergencies.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_tips_34">
		<text>There are different ways to take down different types of mutants; they all have their own weak spots. You can kick tushkanos and rats, too, y'know?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_tips_35">
		<text>Don't go hiding behind a door if some guy's shooting at you. Bullets don't care if there's anything between the two of you... It'll go straight through anything weak.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_tips_36">
		<text>Bandage yourself up if you get blasted or torn up by a mutant. The bleeding will cost you more in medkits than if you use a bandage to stop it before it gets too serious.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_tips_37">
		<text>If you're looking for tools for weapon modifications or suit upgrades, a good place to start is by rifling through stashes. Some traders sell stash coords too, so maybe go check that out.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_tips_38">
		<text>Pay attention to radio chatter, because it's a damn good way to find out what's going on in the area. You'll be able to provide assistance to anyone in a gunfight or surrounded by mutants.</text>
