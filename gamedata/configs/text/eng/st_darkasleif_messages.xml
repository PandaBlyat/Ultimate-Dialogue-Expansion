One of the sorry souls tripped into the flowers and then the others fled in fear. It all happened so fast. After they were gone, I took a closer look. The suits the eggheads wear? They are almost airtight. All that remained of the scientist sloshed around in a yellow suit, like… a soup. Not a single bone to be felt when I prod at it with a branch.</text>

    <text>Take a load off, stalker. We're safe for now.</text>

    <text>Feels good to be surrounded by walls instead of mutants.</text>

    <text>Campfire stories, a warm meal, and some vodka... Now that's living.</text>

    <text>Hey, stalker, think they'll have borscht here? Could go for a bowl right now.</text>

    <text>Don't get too relaxed. Trouble always finds its way in eventually.</text>

    <text>Glad to be back. The Zone's been trying to kill me all day.</text>

    <text>Sell your artefacts, buy some ammo, and grab a drink. That's the plan.</text>

<string id="st_darkasleif_safe_area59">
    <text>Let's take a break and listen to some music. Someone's bound to have a guitar.</text>

<string id="st_darkasleif_safe_area60">
    <text>Time to relax, resupply, and reload. In that order.</text>
</string>

    <text>See if anyone's heard about new anomalies popping up.</text>

    <text>Home sweet base. Let's hope it stays that way.</text>

<string id="st_darkasleif_safe_area67">
    <text>All I need right now is a meal, a drink, and a warm place to crash.</text>

    <text>If I hear one more story about Strelok, I'm gonna lose it.</text>
